  abstract = {Abstract. This paper reviews the literature on neighbour manipulation
	experiments on species intemctions in natural of semi-natural vegetation.
	Three major approaches have been used: 1) introductions into vegetation,
	2) trenching, and 3) vegetation removals. Some studies have used
	a combination of approaches, especially 1) and 3). The removal approach
	has been used most commonly and is given the greatest emphasis in
	this paper accordingly. Details of over 50 such studies are summarized
	here, 48 of which have appeared within only the last two decades.
	We compare and contrast the experimental designs of these studies
	and examine their contributions to the understanding of species interactions
	in vegetation. Evidence for competition is virtually universal among
	these studies. Several studies have also detected evidence of beneficence
	between plant species. Numerous factors may confound interpretations
	in removal experiments including: life stage dependent species responses,
	species-dependent timing and speed of response, inadequacy of controls
	due to temporal and/or spatial variability in site quality, indirect
	effects of treatment on soil moisture content or nutrient levels,
	or on the activities of predators or decomposers, and several constraints
	inherent in particular experimental designs. Another level of complexity
	arises as a consequence of several variables related to plant attributes
	that directly determine the nature of interactions between neighbours
	(e.g. relative competitive abilities, the magnitude of beneficial
	interactions, the extent to which neighbours make demands on the
	same resource units). These may interact in a complex manner to affect
	the response of a {\^a}€˜target{\^a}€{\texttrademark} plant
	to the removal of neighbours. Recommendations for future studies
	are considered and a neighbourhood experimental design is proposed
	which enables analysis of the extent to which the fates of naturally
	established individuals following vegetation removal can be accounted
	for (in multiple regressions) by several variables that reflect different
	properties and circumstances of interaction with immediate Thiessen
	neighbours in the field.},

  abstract = {1. A change in a climate variable may alter a species abundance not
	only through a direct effect on that species vital rates, but also
	through indirect effects mediated by species interactions. While
	recent work has highlighted cases in which indirect effects overwhelm
	the direct effects of climate, we lack robust generalizations to
	predict the strength of indirect effects. 2. For communities dominated
	by non-trophic interactions, we propose that the potential for indirect
	effects of climate change declines with the strength of stabilizing
	niche differences. 3. We tested this hypothesis by analysing an empirically
	parameterized four species population model. We quantified negative
	frequency dependence in population growth rates as a measure of stabilizing
	niche differences and projected the sensitivity of each species to
	direct and indirect effects of climate perturbations. 4. Consistent
	with our hypothesis, species' sensitivities to indirect effects decreased
	rapidly with increasing stabilization by niche differences. 5. Synthesis.
	Information about niche differences can identify species sensitive
	to indirect effects of climate change and determine when multispecies
	forecasting approaches are necessary. However, practical application
	of this generalization will require methods to predict niche differences
	from easily collected data.},

	Currently, we have little understanding of how the importance of
	the storage effect varies among ecosystems. We tested for the three
	conditions of the storage effect in a sagebrush steppe plant community
	in Idaho (USA) by combining long-term observational data with statistical
	models. The four sagebrush steppe species that we studied satisfied
	the first two conditions of the storage effect: a long-lived life
	stage and species-specific responses to the environment. But the
	critical third condition, environment-competition covariance, was
	very weak in this community. While the direction of the covariance
	was consistent with a stabilizing effect of variability (stronger
	competition in more favorable years), its magnitude was small, reflecting
	low temporal variability in both competition and species responses
	to the environment. Consistent with this result, simulations of species
	population growth rates when rare showed that climate variability
	had no consistent stabilizing effect on coexistence. This case study
	provides an important reminder that species-specific responses to
	the environment are not sufficient for coexistence via the storage
	effect. Instead, the magnitude of temporal variability in species
	performance also plays an important role. Comparison of our results
	with those from a similar study in Kansas mixed prairie suggests
	that temporal variability in species performance may reflect both
	the strength of environmental variability as well as life history

  abstract  = {Tropical forests are important reservoirs of biodiversity, but the
	processes that maintain this diversity remain poorly understood.
	The Janzenâ€“Connell hypothesis suggests that specialized natural
	enemies such as insect herbivores and fungal pathogens maintain high
	diversity by elevating mortality when plant species occur at high
	density (negative density dependence; NDD). NDD has been detected
	widely in tropical forests, but the prediction that NDD caused by
	insects and pathogens has a community-wide role in maintaining tropical
	plant diversity remains untested. We show experimentally that changes
	in plant diversity and species composition are caused by fungal pathogens
	and insect herbivores. Effective plant species richness increased
	across the seed-to-seedling transition, corresponding to large changes
	in species composition. Treating seeds and young seedlings with fungicides
	significantly reduced the diversity of the seedling assemblage, consistent
	with the Janzenâ€“Connell hypothesis. Although suppressing insect
	herbivores using insecticides did not alter species diversity, it
	greatly increased seedling recruitment and caused a marked shift
	in seedling species composition. Overall, seedling recruitment was
	significantly reduced at high conspecific seed densities and this
	NDD was greatest for the species that were most abundant as seeds.
	Suppressing fungi reduced the negative effects of density on recruitment,
	confirming that the diversity-enhancing effect of fungi is mediated
	by NDD. Our study provides an overall test of the Janzenâ€“Connell
	hypothesis and demonstrates the crucial role that insects and pathogens
	have both in structuring tropical plant communities and in maintaining
	their remarkable diversity.},

  abstract = {Spatially periodic vegetation patterns, forming gaps, bands, labyrinths,

	models can explain this variety of structures within a unified conceptual
	framework. All these models are based on the interplay of positive
	and negative effects of plants on soil water, but they can be divided
	according to whether they assume the interactions to be mediated
	by water redistribution through runoff/diffusion or by plants' organs.
	We carried out a multi-proxy approach of the processes operating
	in a gapped pattern in southwest Niger dominated by a shrub species.
	Soil moisture within the root layer was monitored in time and space
	over one month of the rainy season. Soil water recharge displayed
	no spatial variation with respect to vegetation cover, but the stock
	half-life under cover was twice that of bare areas. A kernel of facilitation
	by the aboveground parts of shrubs was parameterized, and soil water
	half-life was significantly correlated to the cumulated facilitative
	effects of shrubs. The kernel range was found to be smaller than
	the canopy radius (81\%). This effect of plants on soil water dynamics,
	probably through a reduction of evaporation by shading, is shown
	to be a better explanatory variable than potentially relevant soil
	and topography parameters. The root systems of five individuals of
	Combretum micranthum G. Don were excavated. Root density data were
	used as a proxy to parameterize a kernel function of interplant competition.
	The range of this kernel was larger than the canopy radius (125\%).
	The facilitation-to-competition range ratio, reflecting the above-to-belowground
	ratio of plant lateral extent, was smaller than 1 (0.64), a result
	supporting models assuming that patterning may emerge from an adaptation
	of plant morphology to aridity and shallow soils by means of an extended
	lateral root system. Moreover, observed soil water gradients had
	directions opposite to those assumed by alternative mathematical
	models based on underground water diffusion. This study contributes
	to the growing awareness that combined facilitative and competitive
	plant interactions can induce landscape-scale patterns and shape
	the two-way feedback loops between environment and vegetation},

  abstract = {Abstract. The effects of grazing, physical disturbance, interspecific
	competition, and fire on populations of individual species and on
	the structure and diversity of grassland communities were investigated
	in short-, mid-, and tall-grasslands in the Serengeti National Park,
	Tanzania. The treatments included deep and shallow artificial disturbances,
	early dry-season burning, and removal of dominant grass species from
	2m2 plots located inside and outside of large-mammal-proof exclosures.
	Species-cover data were collected for five years and analyzed by
	analysis of variance and diversity indices. In all three communities,
	protection from grazing and physical disturbance had greater impacts
	on species cover and diversity than removal of dominant species or
	fire. More species were significantly affected (positively and negatively)
	by disturbance and protection from grazing (50 - 100\%) than by species
	removals and fire ({\textless} 41\%). In most cases, the cover of
	tall, perennial species increased following protection from grazing
	while the cover of annual and short, perennial species decreased.
	Over the five years of the study, vegetatively reproducing species
	benefited more than sexually reproducing species from protection
	from grazing, and tall rhizomatous species benefited more than tall
	stoloniferous species. Disturbance caused annual and short perennial
	species to increase and tall perennials to decrease in cover. Following
	species removals, tall species were either unaffected or they increased
	in cover while some short species increased and others decreased
	in cover. Species diversity in two of the three communities decreased
	when the communities were protected from grazing but increased when
	disturbed, when dominant species were removed, and when burned.},

  abstract = {Environmental fluctuations often have different impacts on individuals
	that differ in size, age, or spatial location. To understand how
	population structure, environmental fluctuations, and density-dependent
	interactions influence population dynamics, we provide a general
	theory for persistence for density-dependent matrix models in random
	environments. For populations with compensating density dependence,
	exhibiting ``bounded'' dynamics, and living in a stationary environment,
	we show that persistence is determined by the stochastic growth rate
	(alternatively, dominant Lyapunov exponent) when the population is
	rare. If this stochastic growth rate is negative, then the total
	population abundance goes to zero with probability one. If this stochastic
	growth rate is positive, there is a unique positive stationary distribution.
	Provided there are initially some individuals in the population,
	the population converges in distribution to this stationary distribution
	and the empirical measures almost surely converge to the distribution
	of the stationary distribution. For models with overcompensating
	density-dependence, weaker results are proven. Methods to estimate
	stochastic growth rates are presented. To illustrate the utility
	of these results, applications to unstructured, spatially structured,
	and stage-structured population models are given. For instance, we
	show that diffusively coupled sink populations can persist provided
	that within patch fitness is sufficiently variable in time but not
	strongly correlated across space.},

	Here, we present a new approach where the generation time is envisioned
	as a return time in an appropriate Markov chain. This yields surprisingly
	simple results, such as the fact that the generation time is the
	inverse of the sum of the elasticities of the growth rate to changes
	in the fertilities. This result sheds new light on the interpretation
	of elasticities (which as we show correspond to the frequency of
	events in the ancestral lineage of the population), and we use it
	to generalize a result known as Lebreton's formula. Finally, we also
	show that the generation time can be seen as a random variable, and
	we give a general expression for its distribution.}},

  abstract = {Explaining variation in population growth rates is fundamental to
	predicting population dynamics and population responses to environmental
	change. In this study, we used matrix population models, which link
	birth, growth and survival to population growth rate, to examine
	how and why population growth rates vary within and among 50 terrestrial
	plant species. Population growth rates were more similar within species
	than among species; with phylogeny having a minimal influence on
	among-species variation. Most population growth rates decreased over
	the observation period and were negatively autocorrelated between
	years; that is, higher than average population growth rates tended
	to be followed by lower than average population growth rates. Population
	growth rates varied more through time than space; this temporal variation
	was due mostly to variation in post-seedling survival and for a subset
	of species was partly explained by response to environmental factors,
	such as fire and herbivory. Stochastic population growth rates departed
	from mean matrix population growth rate for temporally autocorrelated
	environments. Our findings indicate that demographic data and models
	of closely related plant species cannot necessarily be used to make
	recommendations for conservation or control, and that post-seedling
	survival and the sequence of environmental conditions are critical
	for determining plant population growth rate.},

  abstract = {Summary Viewing facilitation through the lens of the niche concept
	is one way to unify conceptual and empirical advances about the role
	of facilitation in community ecology. We clarify conceptually and
	through examples from marine and terrestrial environments how facilitation
	can expand species? niches and consider how these interactions can
	be scaled up to understand the importance of facilitation in setting
	a species? geographic range. We then integrate the niche?broadening
	influence of facilitation into current conceptual areas in ecology,
	including climate change, diversity maintenance and the relationship
	between diversity and ecosystem functioning. Because facilitation
	can influence the range of physical conditions under which a species
	can persist, it has the potential to mitigate the effects of climate
	change on species distributions. Whereas facilitation has mostly
	been considered as a diversity?promoting interaction by ameliorating
	abiotic stresses, if facilitated species? niches expand and become
	less distinct as a result of habitat amelioration, the forces that
	maintain diversity and promote coexistence in regions or habitats
	dominated by the facilitator could be reduced (i.e. the sign of the
	effects of facilitation on populations could be species?specific).
	Finally, shifting or broadening ecological niches could alter the
	relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning. A niche?based
	perspective on the effects of facilitation can foster a greater mechanistic
	understanding of the role played by facilitation in regulating species
	coexistence, range shifts and ecosystem functioning in a changing
	world.},

  abstract = {A general model of competitive and apparent competitive interactions
	in a spatially-variable environment is developed and analyzed to
	extend findings on coexistence in a temporally-variable environment
	to the spatial case and to elucidate new principles. In particular,
	coexistence mechanisms are divided into variation-dependent and variation-independent
	mechanisms with variation-dependent mechanisms including spatial
	generalizations of relative nonlinearity and the storage effect.
	Although directly analogous to the corresponding temporal mechanisms,
	these spatial mechanisms involve different life history traits which
	suggest that the spatial storage effect should arise more commonly
	than the temporal storage effect and spatial relative nonlinearity
	should arise less commonly than temporal relative nonlinearity. Additional
	mechanisms occur in the spatial case due to spatial covariance between
	the finite rate of increase of a local population and its local abundance,
	which has no clear temporal analogue. A limited analysis of these
	additional mechanisms shows that they have similar properties to
	the storage effect and relative nonlinearity and potentially may
	be considered as enlargements of the earlier mechanisms. The rate
	of increase of a species perturbed to low density is used to quantify
	coexistence. A general quadratic approximation, which is exact in
	some important cases, divides this rate of increase into contributions
	from the various mechanisms above and admits no other mechanisms,
	suggesting that opportunities for coexistence in a spatially-variable
	environment are fully characterized by these mechanisms within this
	general model. Three spatially-implicit models are analyzed as illustrations
	of the general findings and of techniques using small variance approximations.
	The contributions to coexistence of the various mechanisms are expressed
	in terms of simple interpretable formulae. These spatially-implicit
	models include a model of an annual plant community, a spatial multispecies
	version of the lottery model, and a multispecies model of an insect
	community competing for spatially-patchy and ephemeral food}

  abstract = {Many quantitative traits are labile (e.g. somatic growth rate, reproductive
	timing and investment), varying over the life cycle as a result of
	behavioural adaptation, developmental processes and plastic responses
	to the environment. At the population level, selection can alter
	the distribution of such traits across age classes and among generations.
	Despite a growing body of theoretical research exploring the evolutionary
	dynamics of labile traits, a data-driven framework for incorporating
	such traits into demographic models has not yet been developed. Integral
	projection models (IPMs) are increasingly being used to understand
	the interplay between changes in labile characters, life histories
	and population dynamics. One limitation of the IPM approach is that
	it relies on phenotypic associations between parents and offspring
	traits to capture inheritance. However, it is well-established that
	many different processes may drive these associations, and currently,
	no clear consensus has emerged on how to model micro-evolutionary
	dynamics in an IPM framework. We show how to embed quantitative genetic
	models of inheritance of labile traits into age-structured, two-sex
	models that resemble standard IPMs. Commonly used statistical tools
	such as GLMs and their mixed model counterparts can then be used
	for model parameterization. We illustrate the methodology through
	development of a simple model of egg-laying date evolution, parameterized
	using data from a population of Great tits (Parus major). We demonstrate
	how our framework can be used to project the joint dynamics of species'
	traits and population density. We then develop a simple extension
	of the age-structured Price equation(ASPE) for two-sex populations,
	and apply this to examine the age-specific contributions of different
	processes to change in the mean phenotype and breeding value. The
	data-driven framework we outline here has the potential to facilitate
	greater insight into the nature of selection and its consequences
	in settings where focal traits vary over the lifetime through ontogeny,
	behavioural adaptation and phenotypic plasticity, as well as providing
	a potential bridge between theoretical and empirical studies of labile
	trait variation.},

  abstract   = {* The Janzenâ€“Connell hypothesis proposes that specialist natural
	enemies, such as herbivores and pathogens, maintain diversity in
	plant communities by reducing survival rates of conspecific seeds
	and seedlings located close to reproductive adults or in areas of
	high conspecific density. Variation in the strength of distance-
	and density-dependent effects is hypothesized to explain variation
	in plant species richness along climatic gradients, with effects
	predicted to be stronger in the tropics than the temperate zone and
	in wetter habitats compared to drier habitats.
	
	
	* We conducted a comprehensive literature search to identify peer-reviewed
	experimental studies published in the 40+Â years since the hypothesis
	was first proposed. Using data from these studies, we conducted a
	meta-analysis to assess the current weight of evidence for the distance
	and density predictions of the Janzenâ€“Connell hypothesis.
	
	
	* Overall, we found significant support for both the distance- and
	density-dependent predictions. For all studies combined, survival
	rates were significantly reduced near conspecifics compared to far
	from conspecifics, and in areas with high densities of conspecifics
	compared to areas with low conspecific densities. There was no indication
	that these results were due to publication bias.
	
	
	* The strength of distance and density effects varied widely among
	studies. Contrary to expectations, this variation was unrelated to
	latitude, and there was no significant effect of study region. However,
	we did find a trend for stronger distance and density dependence
	in wetter sites compared to sites with lower annual precipitation.
	In addition, effects were significantly stronger at the seedling
	stage compared to the seed stage.
	
	
	* Synthesis. Our study provides support for the idea that distance-
	and density-dependent mortality occurs in plant communities world-wide.
	Available evidence suggests that natural enemies are frequently the
	cause of such patterns, consistent with the Janzenâ€“Connell
	hypothesis, but additional studies are needed to rule out other mechanisms
	(e.g. intraspecific competition). With the widespread existence of
	density and distance dependence clearly established, future research
	should focus on assessing the degree to which these effects permit
	species coexistence and contribute to the maintenance of diversity

	or retrospectively. In the case of the former, asymptotic expectations
	are generally derived (analytically or numerically) from analysis
	of the potential effects of perturbation of the elements of the life
	table. However, the vital rates that are indicated by prospective
	analysis to contribute the most to projected growth rate are not
	necessarily those that have contributed to observed variation in
	growth rate over time. We used a retrospective analysis to analyze
	the life table responses of a population of long-lived herbivorous
	geese to a systematic reduction in food abundance within the traditional
	breeding colony. Typical of long-lived species, adult survival rate
	has been shown previously in a prospective perturbation analysis
	to have the largest potential impact on projected growth of the population.
	However, despite a significant long-term increase in adult survival
	over the course of the study, there has been a long-term decline
	in growth rates of the population inhabiting the traditional sampling
	areas, although absolute numbers of individuals in both populations
	increased over time. Retrospective assessment of the relative contributions
	of variation in underlying vital rates (adult and juvenile survival,
	in situ recruitment, emigration and immigration rates into the population)
	to projected growth showed that the long-term dynamics of the nesting
	population primarily reflected the combined effects of changes in
	postfledging juvenile survival, while changes in the postnesting
	population were most influenced by variation in juvenile survival
	and adult fidelity rate to the traditional brood-rearing areas. Decreases
	in both juvenile survival and fidelity reflect systematic reductions
	in food abundance over the course of the study. Our results confirm
	previous suggestions that philopatry to the brood-rearing areas may
	be a significantly more plastic trait than fidelity to nesting areas.}},

	which provide an approximation of a complete demographic decomposition.
	The performance of the approximation has not been assessed. 2. We
	compare the performance of the retrospective matrix method to a complete
	decomposition for two bighorn sheep populations and one red deer
	population. 3. Different demographic rates make markedly different
	contributions to variation in growth rate between populations, because
	each population is subject to different types of environmental variation.
	4. The most influential demographic rates identified from decomposing
	observed variation in population growth are often not those showing
	the highest elasticity. Consequently, those demographic rates most
	strongly associated with deterministic population growth are not
	necessarily strongly associated with temporal variation in population
	growth. 5. The retrospective matrix method provides a good approximation
	of the demographic rate associated most strongly with variation in
	population growth. However, failure to incorporate the contribution
	of covariation between demographic rates when decomposing variation
	in population growth can lead to spurious conclusions.}},

  abstract = {{Understanding how the natural world will be impacted by environmental
	change over the coming decades is one of the most pressing challenges
	facing humanity. Addressing this challenge is difficult because environmental
	change can generate both population-level plastic and evolutionary
	responses, with plastic responses being either adaptive or nonadaptive.
	We develop an approach that links quantitative genetic theory with
	data-driven structured models to allow prediction of population responses
	to environmental change via plasticity and adaptive evolution. After
	introducing general new theory, we construct a number of example
	models to demonstrate that evolutionary responses to environmental
	change over the short-term will be considerably slower than plastic
	responses and that the rate of adaptive evolution to a new environment
	depends on whether plastic responses are adaptive or nonadaptive.
	Parameterization of the models we develop requires information on
	genetic and phenotypic variation and demography that will not always
	be available, meaning that simpler models will often be required
	to predict responses to environmental change. We consequently develop
	a method to examine whether the full machinery of the evolutionarily
	explicit models we develop will be needed to predict responses to
	environmental change or whether simpler nonevolutionary models that
	are now widely constructed may be sufficient.}},

	change simultaneously influencing population dynamics, life history
	and quantitative characters. We do not have a well-developed understanding
	of links between the dynamics of these quantities. 2. Insight into
	the joint dynamics of populations, quantitative characters and life
	history can be gained by deriving a model that allows the calculation
	of fundamental quantities that underpin population ecology, evolutionary
	biology and life history. The parameterization and analysis of such
	a model for a specific system can be used to predict how a population
	will respond to environmental change. 3. Age-stage-structured models
	can be constructed from character-demography associations that describe
	age-specific relationships between the character and: (i) survival;
	(ii) fertility; (iii) ontogenetic development of the character among
	survivors; and (iv) the distribution of reproductive allocation.
	4. These models can be used to calculate a wide range of useful biological
	quantities including population growth and structure; terms in the
	Price equation including selection differentials; estimates of biometric
	heritabilities; and life history descriptors including generation
	time. We showcase the method through parameterization of a model
	using data from a well-studied population of Soay sheep Ovis aries.
	5. Perturbation analysis is used to investigate how the quantities
	listed in summary point 4 change as each parameter in each character-demography
	function is altered. 6. A wide range of joint dynamics of life history,
	quantitative characters and population growth can be generated in
	response to changes in different character-demography associations;
	we argue this explains the diversity of observations on the consequences
	of environmental change from studies of free-living populations.
	7. The approach we describe has the potential to explain within and
	between species patterns in quantitative characters, life history
	and population dynamics.},

	in his fundamental theorem of natural selection is combined with
	reproductive values as appropriately defined in the context of both
	random environments and continuing fluctuations in the distribution
	over classes in a class-structured population. We obtain astonishingly
	simple results, generalisations of the Price Equation and the fundamental
	theorem, that show natural selection acting only through the arithmetic
	expectation of fitness over all uncertainties, in contrast to previous
	studies with fluctuating demography, in which natural selection looks
	rather complicated. Furthermore, our setting permits each class to
	have its characteristic ploidy, thus covering haploidy, diploidy
	and haplodiploidy at the same time; and allows arbitrary classes,
	including continuous variables such as condition. The simplicity
	is achieved by focussing just on the effects of natural selection
	on genotype frequencies: while other causes are present in the model,
	and the effect of natural selection is assessed in their presence,
	these causes will have their own further effects on genoytpe frequencies
	that are not assessed here. Also, Fisher's uses of reproductive value
	are shown to have two ambivalences, and a new axiomatic foundation
	for reproductive value is endorsed. The results continue the formal
	darwinism project, and extend support for the individual-as-maximising-agent
	analogy to finite populations with random environments and fluctuating
	class-distributions. The model may also lead to improved ways to
	measure fitness in real populations.}},

	nitrate (R*) and light (I*). In six pairwise combinations, the species
	with the lower R* and I* excluded its competitor, as predicted by
	theory. In the remaining two pairwise combinations, one species had
	a lowerR*, and the second had a lower I*; these species pairs coexisted,
	although it is unclear whether * I resource competition alone was
	responsible for their coexistence. Smaller differences in R* or I*
	between competing species led to slower rates of competitive exclusion,
	and the influence of differences on the rate of competitive exclusion
	was more pronounced on low-nitrogen soils, while the influence I*
	of differences was more pronounced on high-nitrogen ( low-light)
	soils. These results were not explained by differences in initial
	species abundances or neutrality. However, only a few of our paired
	species coexisted under our experimentally imposed conditions ( homogeneous
	soils, high seeding densities, minimal disturbance, regular water,

	the "integral projection model," which eliminates the need for division

	assumptions. Like a traditional matrix model, the integral projection
	model provides estimates of the asymptotic growth rare, stable size
	distribution, reproductive values, and sensitivities of the growth
	rate to changes in vital rates. However, where the matrix model represents
	the size distributions, reproductive value, and sensitivities as
	step functions (constant within a stage class), the integral projection
	model yields smooth curves fur each of these as a function of individual
	size. We describe a method for fitting the model to data, and we
	apply this method to data on an endangered plant species, northern
	monkshood (Aconitum noveboracense). With individuals classified by
	stem diameter. The matrix and integral models yield similar estimates
	of the asymptotic growth rate, bur the reproductive values and sensitivities
	in the matrix model are sensitive to the choice of stage classes.
	The integral projection model avoids this problem and yields size-specific
	sensitivities that are not affected by stags duration. These general
	properties of the integral projection model will make it advantageous
	for other populations where there is no natural division of individuals
	into stage classes.}

  abstract = {We study the form of polymorphisms that can be maintained by the joint
	effects of generation overlap and randomly fluctuating selection,
	acting on a quantitative trait affecting offspring viability. The
	genetic system can be single locus or multilocus, haploid or diploid
	Selection is assumed to be stabilizing with a randomly fluctuating
	optimum, and we assume additive allelic effects without epistasis.
	For fluctuations above a certain threshold, nonzero genetic variance
	is maintained in an evolutionarily stable population. Our model allows
	a continuum of alleles with arbitrary effects at each locus. Nonetheless,
	the genotype distribution in an evolutionarily stable population
	is discrete-a polymorphism of a few alleles with distinctly different
	effects-and often involves only a pair of alleles at each locus.
	The form of the genotype distribution depends on the number of loci
	affecting the trait, and on the kurtosis of the distribution of the
	phenotypic optimum theta. If the trait is affected by several loci,
	the number of polymorphic loci increases with increased variance
	of fluctuations in selection. For distributions of theta with negative
	kurtosis (i.e., lower kurtosis than a Gaussian) the number of polymorphic
	loci increases gradually (0 --> 1 --> 2 --> ... M), and the genetic
	variability is in the form of a few diallelic or triallelic loci
	with alleles of large effect. For distributions with positive kurtosis,
	the increase is abrupt (0 --> many) and involves many diallelic loci.
	These results do not fit the conventional multivariate Gaussian or
	near-Gaussian models for quantitative traits, but may partially explain
	recent findings that heritable variation in natural populations is
	often due to genes of large effect. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract = {Stochastic matrix projection models are widely used to model age-
	or stage-structured populations with vital rates that fluctuate randomly
	over time. Practical applications of these models rest on qualitative
	properties such as the existence of a long term population growth
	rate, asymptotic log-normality of total population size, and weak
	ergodicity of population structure. We show here that these properties
	are shared by a general stochastic integral projection model, by
	using results in (Eveson in D. Phil. Thesis, University of Sussex,
	1991, Eveson in Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. 70, 411-440, 1993) to extend
	the approach in (Lange and Holmes in J. Appl. Prob. 18, 325-344,
	1981). Integral projection models allow individuals to be cross-classified
	by multiple attributes, either discrete or continuous, and allow
	the classification to change during the life cycle. These features
	are present in plant populations with size and age as important predictors
	of individual fate, populations with a persistent bank of dormant
	seeds or eggs, and animal species with complex life cycles. We also
	present a case-study based on a 6-year field study of the Illyrian
	thistle, Onopordum illyricum, to demonstrate how easily a stochastic
	integral model can be parameterized from field data and then applied
	using familiar matrix software and methods. Thistle demography is
	affected by multiple traits (size, age and a latent "quality" variable),
	which would be difficult to accommodate in a classical matrix model.
	We use the model to explore the evolution of size- and age-dependent
	flowering using an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) approach.
	We find close agreement between the observed flowering behavior and
	the predicted ESS from the stochastic model, whereas the ESS predicted
	from a deterministic version of the model is very different from
	observed flowering behavior. These results strongly suggest that
	the flowering strategy in O. illyricum is an adaptation to random
	between-year variation in vital rates.},

  abstract = {Matrix projection models occupy a central role in population and conservation
	biology. Matrix models divide a population into discrete classes,
	even if the structuring trait exhibits continuous variation ( e.
	g., body size). The integral projection model ( IPM) avoids discrete
	classes and potential artifacts from arbitrary class divisions, facilitates
	parsimonious modeling based on smooth relationships between individual
	state and demographic performance, and can be implemented with standard
	matrix software. Here, we extend the IPM to species with complex
	demographic attributes, including dormant and active life stages,
	cross- classification by several attributes ( e. g., size, age, and
	condition), and changes between discrete and continuous structure
	over the life cycle. We present a general model encompassing these
	cases, numerical methods, and theoretical results, including stable
	population growth and sensitivity/ elasticity analysis for density-
	independent models, local stability analysis in density- dependent
	models, and optimal/ evolutionarily stable strategy life- history
	analysis. Our presentation centers on an IPM for the thistle Onopordum
	illyricum based on a 6- year field study. Flowering and death probabilities
	are size and age dependent, and individuals also vary in a latent
	attribute affecting survival, but a predictively accurate IPM is
	completely parameterized by fitting a few regression equations. The
	online edition of the American Naturalist includes a zip archive
	of R scripts illustrating our suggested methods.}

	combine to affect the rate of spread of an invading species. Our
	model combines state-structured local demography (specified by an
	integral or matrix projection model) with general dispersal distributions
	that may depend on the state of the individual or its parent. It
	allows very general patterns of stationary temporal variation in
	both local demography and in the frequency and distribution of dispersal
	distances. We show that expressions for the asymptotic spread rate
	and its sensitivity to parameters, which have been derived previously
	for less general models, continue to hold. Using these results we
	show that random temporal variability in dispersal can accelerate
	population spread. Demographic variability can further accelerate
	spread if it is positively correlated with dispersal variability,
	for example if high-fecundity years are also years in which juveniles
	tend to settle further away from their parents. A simple model for
	the growth and spread of patches of an invasive plant (perennial
	pepperweed, Lepidium latifolium) illustrates these effects and shows
	that they can have substantial impacts on the predicted speed of
	an invasion wave. Temporal variability in dispersal has received
	very little attention in both the theoretical and empirical literature
	on invasive species spread. Our results suggest that this needs to

  abstract = {1. Understanding how vital rates and reproductive value change with
	age is fundamental to demography, life history evolution and population
	genetics. The universality of organism senescence has been questioned
	on both theoretical and empirical grounds, and the prevalence and
	strength of senescence remain a controversial issue. Plants are particularly
	interesting for studies of senescence since individuals of many species
	have been reported to reach very high ages. 2. In this study, we
	examined whether the herb Borderea pyrenaica, known to reach ages
	of more than 300 years, experiences senescence. We collected detailed
	demographic information from male and female individuals in two populations
	over 5 years. An unusual morphological feature in this species enabled
	us to obtain exact age estimates for each of the individuals at the
	end of the demographic study. 3. We used restricted cubic regression
	splines and generalized linear models to determine nonlinear effects
	of age and size on vital rates. We then incorporated the effects
	of age and size in integral projection models of demography for determining
	the relationship between age and reproductive value. As the species
	is dioecious, we performed analyses separately for males and females
	and examined also the hypothesis that a larger reproductive effort
	in females comes at a senescence cost. 4. We found no evidence for
	senescence. Recorded individuals reached 260 years, but growth and
	fecundity of female and male individuals did not decrease at high
	ages, and survival and reproductive value increased with age. The
	results were qualitatively similar also when accounting for size
	and among-individual vital rate heterogeneity, with the exception
	that male flowering probability decreased with age when accounting
	for size increases. 5. Synthesis. Overall, our results show that
	performance of both male and female plants of B. pyrenaica may increase
	rather than decrease at ages up to several centuries, and they support
	the notion that senescence may be negligible in long-lived modular
	organisms. This highlights the need to explore mechanisms that enable
	some species to maintain high reproductive values also at very high
	ages and to identify the evolutionary reasons why some organisms
	appear to experience no or negligible senescence.}

  abstract = {{We surveyed the literature published since 1985 for evidence of natural
	selection and heritability in vegetative functional traits and performance.
	Our goals were to (1) review patterns of selection on specific functional
	traits and (2) assess general evolutionary questions about selection
	and heritability for broad classes of traits. While generalizations
	about the functional significance of specific traits are premature,
	several functional hypotheses are supported. For example, herbivores
	can exert strong selection on secondary chemistry and mechanical
	defenses, but costs of resistance and negative correlations between
	defense traits may constrain their evolution. Competitive interactions
	select for early germination and favor stem elongation and shifts
	in flowering time where such responses actually minimize competitive
	effects. In the very few studies of physiology, selection on gas
	exchange and leaf size is clearly environment dependent. More generally,
	in reciprocal transplant experiments, populations often are locally
	adapted, and selection favors the native phenotype. These results
	suggest that selection is important in functional trait evolution
	and population differentiation. At the same time, selection often
	varies in space and time and across life-history episodes. This variation
	could slow the rate of evolutionary change, maintain genetic variation
	within populations, and select for plasticity. Analyses of general
	questions revealed that indirect selection through correlated characters
	accounts for a substantial portion of total selection on traits and
	often appears to reinforce the pattern of direct selection. This
	could be due to environmental effects on multiple phenotypic traits
	and fitness. Alternatively, indirect selection could contribute to
	the rapid evolution of suites of traits. We found only weak evidence
	that traits under strong selection have low heritability, a pattern
	that has been reported for animals and predicted by some theory.
	Thus, the rate of evolutionary change may well differ among traits.
	The strength of selection also depended on the fitness measure, being
	stronger selection through cumulative fitness than fertility or vegetative
	performance. Attributes of species' biology and experimental design
	affected selection and heritability estimates. Heritability was lower
	in inbreeding species relative to outbreeders, as expected. Heritabilities
	in controlled environments substantially overestimate estimates from
	the wild and should not be used as reliable predictors of the rate
	of adaptive evolutionary change in natural populations. Likewise,
	broad-sense heritability overestimates narrow-sense heritability
	and is thus unreliable for predicting evolutionary change in outbreeding
	species. Future studies of functional trait evolution should focus
	on physiology and a broader array of phenological and developmental
	traits. Long-lived species are severely underrepresented in microevolutionary
	studies, no doubt for practical reasons. Finally, an emphasis should
	be placed on exploring the nature and effect of trait interactions
	on fitness, since these are likely to be very important in shaping
	the course of evolution.}},

  abstract = {Abstract Although positive interactions between species are well documented,
	most ecological theory for investigating multispecies coexistence
	remains rooted in antagonistic interactions such as competition and
	predation. Standard resource?competition models from this theory
	predict that the number of coexisting species should not exceed the
	number of factors that limit population growth. Here I show that
	positive interactions among resource competitors can produce species?rich
	model communities supported by a single limiting resource. Simulations
	show that when resource competitors reduce each others? per capita
	mortality rate (e.g. by ameliorating an abiotic stress), stable multispecies
	coexistence with a single resource may be common, even while the
	net interspecific interaction remains negative. These results demonstrate
	that positive interactions may provide an important mechanism for
	generating species?rich communities in nature. They also show that
	focusing on the net interaction between species may conceal important
	coexistence mechanisms when species simultaneously engage in both
	antagonistic and positive interactions.},

  abstract = {{Environmental fluctuation between generations can lead to mixed optimal
	strategies (so-called `'bet-hedging''). Due to mathematical intractability,
	however, optimality modelling has up to now largely ignored the effects
	of such fluctuations. The cases that have been considered so far
	are relatively simple. We show that the optimal strategy can be calculated
	explicitly for the case of non-structured populations. an environmental
	parameter which varies over generations according to an ergodic process
	and certain types of payoff functions (specifying the relationship
	between an individual's trait value, the environment, and its expected
	contribution to the populations size in the next generation). Our
	results also lead to numerical solutions for other cases. Situations
	with and without information about the environment are considered.
	In both cases, there is a minimum environmental variability above
	which mixed strategies are optimal. Examination of the differences
	between long-term reproductive success of constrained purr strategies
	and optimal mixed strategies indicates that there is a high selection
	pressure for mixed strategies to evolve unless individuals can acquire
	highly accurate information about their environment. We show that
	the solution is robust in the sense that it has near to optimal long-term
	reproductive success under small perturbations of the payoff function
	and/or the distribution of the environmental parameter. (C) 1995

  abstract = {The study of positive species interactions is a rapidly evolving field
	in ecology. Despite decades of research, controversy has emerged
	as to whether positive and negative interactions predictably shift
	with increasing environmental stress as hypothesised by the stress-gradient
	hypothesis (SGH). Here, we provide a synthesis of 727 tests of the
	SGH in plant communities across the globe to examine its generality
	across a variety of ecological factors. Our results show that plant
	interactions change with stress through an outright shift to facilitation
	(survival) or a reduction in competition (growth and reproduction).
	In a limited number of cases, plant interactions do not respond to
	stress, but they never shift towards competition with stress. These
	findings are consistent across stress types, plant growth forms,
	life histories, origins (invasive vs. native), climates, ecosystems
	and methodologies, though the magnitude of the shifts towards facilitation
	with stress is dependent on these factors. We suggest that future
	studies should employ standardised definitions and protocols to test
	the SGH, take a multi-factorial approach that considers variables
	such as plant traits in addition to stress, and apply the SGH to
	better understand how species and communities will respond to environmental
	change.},

	production of multiple offspring types affect the population dynamics
	and evolution of delayed reproduction in a clonal perennial herb
	with monocarpic ramets (white hellebore). In this species, flowering
	ramets produce both seeds and asexual offspring. Data on ramet demography
	are used to parameterize integral projection models, which allow
	the effects of habitat-specific demographic variation and reproductive
	mode on population dynamics to be quantified. We then use the evolutionarily
	stable strategy (ESS) approach to predict the flowering strategy-the
	relationship between flowering probability and size. This approach
	is extended to allow offspring types to have different demographies
	and density-dependent responses. Our results demonstrate that the
	evolutionarily stable flowering strategies differ substantially among
	habitats and are in excellent agreement with the observed strategies.
	Reproductive mode, however, has little effect on the ESSs. Using
	analytical approximations, we show that flowering decisions are predominantly
	determined by the asymptotic size of individuals rather than variation
	in survival or size-fecundity relationships. We conclude that habitat
	is an important aspect of the selective environment and a significant

  abstract  = {Most species have one or more natural enemies, e.g., predators, parasites,
	pathogens, and herbivores, among others. These species in turn typically
	attack multiple victim species. This leads to the possibility of
	indirect interactions among those victims, both positive and negative.
	The term apparent competition commonly denotes negative indirect
	interactions between victim species that arise because they share
	a natural enemy. This indirect interaction, which in principle can
	be reflected in many facets of the distribution and abundance of
	individual species and more broadly govern the structure of ecological
	communities in time and space, pervades many natural ecosystems.
	It also is a central theme in many applied ecological problems, including
	the control of agricultural pests, harvesting, the conservation of
	endangered species, and the dynamics of emerging diseases. At one
	end of the scale of life, apparent competition characterizes intriguing
	aspects of dynamics within individual organismsâ€?for example,
	the immune system is akin in many ways to a predator that can induce
	negative indirect interactions among different pathogens. At intermediate
	scales of biological organization, the existence and strength of
	apparent competition depend upon many contingent details of individual
	behavior and life history, as well as the community and spatial context
	within which indirect interactions play out. At the broadest scale
	of macroecology and macroevolution, apparent competition may play
	a major, if poorly understood, role in the evolution of speciesâ€™
	geographical ranges and adaptive radiations.},

	size was almost three times as large in shaded environments as in
	light environments. Plants in open woodlands flowered more frequently
	over the years, showed less size regression after flowering and produced
	significantly more fruits than plants in shaded environments, resulting
	in significantly larger population growth rates. 4. Our life cycle
	models revealed that costs of reproduction, measured at the population-level,
	were small in the light environment, and more than buffered by the
	increase in survival of flowering plants compared to non-flowering
	plants. In the shade environment, however, the costs of reproduction
	were significant and made the difference between a stable (current)
	and a growing (without reproduction costs) population. 5. Synthesis.
	Light penetration to the soil is a key variable determining population
	dynamics of woodland orchids. Our analyses show that differences
	in vital rates related to size-dependent reproduction (flowering)
	and growth are essential drivers of changes in orchid population
	dynamics in different light environments. The combination of IPMs
	and LTREs thus proves to be very useful when studying the fitness
	consequences of size- and context-dependent phenomena like flowering
	strategies and costs of reproduction.}

  abstract = {Summary 1 Many plant species are currently restricted to small and
	isolated populations as a result of habitat destruction and fragmentation.
	Lack of sufficient data often leads to spatial variation being substituted
	for temporal variation in models to evaluate man- agement options,
	but variation in population growth rate ( $\lambda$ ) between sites
	or over years may be caused by variation in different life history
	components. 2 We studied the demography of three coexisting and related
	perennial herbs (the long- lived perennial Succisa pratensis , the
	shorter-lived Hypochaeris radicata and the long- lived, but more
	clonal Centaurea jacea ) in the same plots over 4 years (1999–2003).
	3 Life table response experiment analysis revealed that temporal
	and spatial variation in the life history components of S. pratensis
	and H. radicata were qualitatively differ- ent: variation in fecundity
	contributed most to variation in $\lambda$ between sites, but variation
	in growth contributed most to variation between years. 4 In years
	with a below average $\lambda$ , most life history components of
	S. pratensis and H. radicata had lower transition probabilities,
	whereas the reasons for low population growth differed between the
	three poor sites. All major life history components of S. pratensis
	had lower probabilities in the most productive of these sites, but
	in the other two, negative contributions from some components (fecundity
	or growth) were partly compensated for by positive contributions
	from others (growth or stasis). 5 Centaurea jacea showed a different
	pattern: in poor years, negative contributions from some life history
	components were buffered by positive contributions from other components;
	however, this buffering did not occur in poor sites. 6 Our analysis
	shows that the population dynamics of perennial plants may respond
	differently to temporal and spatial variation in environmental conditions.
	Moreover, co-occurring species with similar life histories responded
	differently to the same spatio- temporal variation. We conclude that
	temporal and spatial dynamics cannot readily be interchanged in population
	viability analyses and management studies, as such sub- stitution
	may lead to incorrect projections of a species' population dynamics
	in time.},

  abstract = {{Pathogens and insect pests have become increasingly important drivers
	of tree mortality in forested ecosystems. Unfortunately, understanding
	the relative contributions of multiple mortality agents to the population
	decline of trees is difficult, because it requires frequent measures
	of tree survival, growth, and recruitment, as well as the incidence
	of mortality agents. We present a population model of white bark
	pine (Pinus albicaulis), a high-elevation tree undergoing rapid decline
	in western North America. The loss of whitebark pine is thought to
	be primarily due to an invasive pathogen (white pine blister rust;
	Cronartium ribicola) and a native insect (mountain pine beetle; Dendroctonus
	ponderosae). We utilized seven plots in Crater Lake National Park
	(Oregon, USA) where 1220 trees were surveyed for health and the presence
	of blister rust and beetle activity annually from 2003-2014, except
	2008. We constructed size-based projection matrices for nine years
	and calculated the deterministic growth rate (lambda) using an average
	matrix and the stochastic growth rate (As) by simulation for whitebark
	pine in our study population. We then assessed the roles of blister
	rust and beetles by calculating lambda and lambda(s) using matrices
	in which we removed trees with blister rust and, separately, trees
	with beetles. We also conducted life table response experiments (LTRE)
	to determine which demographic changes contributed most to differences
	in lambda between ambient conditions and the two other scenarios.
	The model suggests that whitebark pine in our plots are currently
	declining 1.1\% per year (lambda = 0.9888, lambda(s) = 0.9899). Removing
	blister rust from the models resulted in almost no increase in growth
	(lambda = 0.9916, lambda(s) = 0.9930), while removing beetles resulted
	in a larger increase in growth (lambda = 1.0028, lambda(s) = 1.0045).
	The LTRE demonstrated that reductions in stasis of the three largest
	size classes due to beetles contributed most to the smaller lambda
	in the ambient condition. Our work demonstrates a method for assessing
	the relative effects of different mortality agents on declining tree
	populations, and it shows that the effects of insects and pathogens
	can be markedly different from one another. In our study, beetle
	activity significantly reduced tree population growth while a pathogen
	had minimal effect, thus management actions to stabilize our study
	population will likely need to include reducing beetle activity.

  abstract = {1 We evaluated the responses of native grassland sods to a variety
	of types of disturbance in order to assess hypotheses about the competitive
	effects of established vegetation on seed germination and seedling
	establishment. In particular, we consider whether germination is
	more responsive to the magnitude and duration of vegetation removal
	(competitive release) or to individual disturbance types (specific
	effects). 2 Field-collected sods of coastal tallgrass prairie were
	subjected to no manipulation, cutting with clippings left, cutting
	with clippings removed (hayed), burning, and complete destruction
	of established vegetation under greenhouse conditions. The emergence
	and fate of seedlings, as well as light penetration through the canopy,
	were followed for a period of 4.5{\^A} months. 3 Total seedling emergence
	increased from cut to control, hayed, burned and plants-removed treatments.
	Several periods of increased seedling emergence suggested responses
	to both light penetration and seasonal change. 4 Species richness
	was lowest in cut sods and highest in sods that had plants removed
	or were burned. Rarefaction analysis showed that these differences
	were largely those expected from differences in seedling number,
	except for the cut treatment, which produced fewer species per seedling
	than other treatments. 5 Indicator species analysis and ordination
	methods revealed that seedling community composition overlapped strongly
	across all treatments, although the area of ordination space did
	increase with increasing numbers of seedlings. 6 Overall, most of
	the effects of disturbance could be explained by cumulative light
	penetration to the soil surface, an indicator of total competitive
	release, although a few specific effects could be found (particularly
	for the cutting treatment). Thus, these results generally support
	the competitive release hypothesis.},

  pages = {1 - 12},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Abstract.— If the direction of selection changes from generation
	to generation, the ability to respond to selection is maladaptive:
	the response to selection in one generation leads to reduced fitness
	in the next. Because the response is determined by the amount of
	genetic variance expressed at the phenotypic level, rapidly fluctuating
	selection should favor modifier genes that reduce the phenotypic
	effect of alleles segregating at structural loci underlying the trait.
	Such reduction in phenotypic expression of genetic variation has
	been named “genetic canalization.? I support this argument with
	a series of two? and multilocus models with alternating linear
	selection and Gaussian selection with fluctuating optimum. A canalizing
	modifier gene affects the fitness of its carriers in three ways:
	(1) it reduces the phenotypic consequences of genetic response to
	previous selection; (2) it reduces the genetic response to selection,
	which is manifested as linkage disequilibrium between the modifier
	and structural loci; and (3) it reduces the phenotypic variance.
	The first two effects reduce fitness under directional selection
	sustained for several generations, but improve fitness when the direction
	of selection has just been reversed. The net effect tends to favor
	a canalizing modifier under rapidly fluctuating selection regimes
	(period of eight generations or less). The third effect improves
	fitness of the modifier allele if the fitness function is convex
	and reduces it if the function is concave. Under fluctuating Gaussian
	selection, the population is more likely to experience the concave
	portion of the fitness function when selection is stronger. Therefore,
	only weak to moderately strong fluctuating Gaussian selection favors
	genetic canalization. This paper considerably broadens the conditions
	that favor genetic canalization, which so far has only been postulated
	to evolve under long?term stabilizing selection.},

	We reviewed the literature from 1984 through 1997 for studies that
	estimated the strength of linear and quadratic selection in terms
	of standardized selection gradients or differentials on natural variation
	in quantitative traits for field populations. We tabulated 63 published
	studies of 62 species that reported over 2,500 estimates of linear
	or quadratic selection. More than 80\% of the estimates were for
	morphological traits; there is very little data for behavioral or
	physiological traits. Most published selection studies were unreplicated
	and had sample sizes below 135 individuals, resulting in low statistical
	power to detect selection of the magnitude typically reported for
	natural populations. The absolute values of linear selection gradients
	\textbackslash{}beta\textbackslash{} were exponentially distributed
	with an overall median of 0.16, suggesting that strong directional
	selection was uncommon. The values of \textbackslash{}beta\textbackslash{}
	for selection on morphological and on life- history/ phenological
	traits were significantly different: on average, selection on morphology
	was stronger than selection on phenology/ life history. Similarly,
	the values of \textbackslash{}beta\textbackslash{} for selection
	via aspects of survival, fecundity, and mating success were significantly
	different: on average, selection on mating success was stronger than
	on survival. Comparisons of estimated linear selection gradients
	and differentials suggest that indirect components of phenotypic
	selection were usually modest relative to direct components. The
	absolute values of quadratic selection gradients \textbackslash{}gamma\textbackslash{}
	were exponentially distributed with an overall median of only 0.10,
	suggesting that quadratic selection is typically quite weak. The
	distribution of gamma values was symmetric about 0, providing no
	evidence that stabilizing selection is stronger or more common than
	disruptive selection in nature.},

	environmental change. Theory developed with phenomenological competition
	models shows that indirect effects are weak when coexistence is strongly
	stabilized, but these models lack a mechanistic link between environmental
	change and species performance. To extend existing theory, we examined
	the relationship between coexistence and indirect effects in mechanistic
	resource competition models. We defined environmental change as a
	change in resource supply points and quantified the resulting competition-mediated
	indirect effects on species abundances. We found that the magnitude
	of indirect effects increases in proportion to niche overlap. However,
	indirect effects also depend on differences in how competitors respond
	to the change in resource supply, an insight hidden in nonmechanistic
	models. Our analysis demonstrates the value of using niche overlap
	to predict the strength of indirect effects and clarifies the types
	of indirect effects that global change can have on competing species.},

	Our results show that the mean competition strengths fall as assembly
	progresses and that most interactions in the communities formed are
	weak. Communities that are invulnerable to further invasions are
	those where interspecific interactions are weaker than the average
	interaction strength between species in the pool. If these results

  abstract = {Plants often interact with antagonists such as herbivores or pathogens.
	Negative effects on individual plant performance are widely documented,
	but less is known about whether such effects translate into effects
	on population viability. In temperate forests, important herbivores
	include deer. During 2006-2009, I compared vital rates and population
	growth rates (calculated using integral projection models) between
	fenced exclosures and grazed control areas, using the perennial herb
	Phyteuma spicatum as a model species. Deer caused the largest damage
	to flowering individuals, removing about 24\% of all inflorescences
	and 13\% of the above-ground biomass. Only few vital rates seemed
	to be negatively affected by deer (mainly seed production) and this
	did not translate into effects on population growth rate. Contrary
	to expectations, population growth rates tended to be lower in the
	fenced exclosures in 1 year. This was likely caused by high-pathogen
	infestation rates, which negatively affected the probability of adult
	survival and growth. Population growth rate was more sensitive to
	changes in these vital rates than to changes in seed production.
	In summary, the results of this demographic study show that grazing
	effects may be small for long-lived herbs, and that negative effects
	on vital rates such as seed production may not always translate into
	effects on population growth rate. The findings also illustrate that
	other antagonists such as pathogens may be of greater relative importance
	for differences in population performance than herbivores.},

  abstract = {{Identifying the demographic parameters (e.g., reproduction, survival,
	dispersal) that most influence population dynamics can increase conservation
	effectiveness and enhance ecological understanding. Life table response
	experiments (LTRE) aim to decompose the effects of change in parameters
	on past demographic outcomes (e.g., population growth rates). But
	the vast majority of LTREs and other retrospective population analyses
	have focused on decomposing asymptotic population growth rates, which
	do not account for the dynamic interplay between population structure
	and vital rates that shape realized population growth rates (lambda(t)
	= Nt+1/N-t) in time-varying environments. We provide an empirical
	means to overcome these shortcomings by merging recently developed
	``transient life-table response experiments{''} with integrated population
	models (IPMs). IPMs allow for the estimation of latent population
	structure and other demographic parameters that are required for
	transient LTRE analysis, and Bayesian versions additionally allow
	for complete error propagation from the estimation of demographic
	parameters to derivations of realized population growth rates and
	perturbation analyses of growth rates. By integrating available monitoring
	data for Lesser Scaup over 60 yr, and conducting transient LTREs
	on IPM estimates, we found that the contribution of juvenile female
	survival to long-term variation in realized population growth rates
	was 1.6 and 3.7 times larger than that of adult female survival and
	fecundity, respectively. But a persistent long-term decline in fecundity
	explained 92\% of the decline in abundance between 1983 and 2006.
	In contrast, an improvement in adult female survival drove the modest
	recovery in Lesser Scaup abundance since 2006, indicating that the
	most important demographic drivers of Lesser Scaup population dynamics
	are temporally dynamic. In addition to resolving uncertainty about
	Lesser Scaup population dynamics, the merger of IPMs with transient
	LTREs will strengthen our understanding of demography for many species
	as we aim to conserve biodiversity during an era of non-stationary
	global change.}},

	to have globally consistent effects on individual plant physiological
	functions, but how these effects scale up to influence competition,
	a key driver of community assembly in terrestrial vegetation, has
	remained unclear. Here we use growth data from more than 3 million
	trees in over 140,000 plots across the world to show how three key
	functional traits{\^a}€''wood density, specific leaf area and maximum
	height{\^a}€''consistently influence competitive interactions.
	Fast maximum growth of a species was correlated negatively with its
	wood density in all biomes, and positively with its specific leaf
	area in most biomes. Low wood density was also correlated with a
	low ability to tolerate competition and a low competitive effect
	on neighbours, while high specific leaf area was correlated with
	a low competitive effect. Thus, traits generate trade-offs between
	performance with competition versus performance without competition,
	a fundamental ingredient in the classical hypothesis that the coexistence
	of plant species is enabled via differentiation in their successional
	strategies. Competition within species was stronger than between
	species, but an increase in trait dissimilarity between species had
	little influence in weakening competition. No benefit of dissimilarity
	was detected for specific leaf area or wood density, and only a weak
	benefit for maximum height. Our trait-based approach to modelling
	competition makes generalization possible across the forest ecosystems

  abstract = {1. The evolution of flowering strategies (when and at what size to
	flower) in monocarpic perennials is determined by balancing current
	reproduction with expected future reproduction, and these are largely
	determined by size-specific patterns of growth and survival. However,
	because of the difficulty in following long-lived individuals throughout
	their lives, this theory has largely been tested using short-lived
	species (< 5 years). 2. Here, we tested this theory using the long-lived
	monocarpic perennial Campanula thyrsoides which can live up to 16
	years. We used a novel approach that combined permanent plot and
	herb chronology data from a 3-year field study to parameterize and
	validate integral projection models (IPMs). 3. Similar to other monocarpic
	species, the rosette leaves of C. thyrsoides wither over winter and
	so size cannot be measured in the year of flowering. We therefore
	extended the existing IPM framework to incorporate an additional
	time delay that arises because flowering demography must be predicted
	from rosette size in the year before flowering. 4. We found that
	all main demographic functions (growth, survival probability, flowering
	probability and fecundity) were strongly size-dependent and there

	flower) in monocarpic perennials is determined by balancing current
	reproduction with expected future reproduction, and these are largely
	determined by size-specific patterns of growth and survival. However,
	because of the difficulty in following long-lived individuals throughout
	their lives, this theory has largely been tested using short-lived
	species ( < 5 years). 2. Here, we tested this theory using the long-lived
	monocarpic perennial Campanula thyrsoides which can live up to 16
	years. We used a novel approach that combined permanent plot and
	herb chronology data from a 3-year field study to parameterize and
	validate integral projection models (IPMs). 3. Similar to other monocarpic
	species, the rosette leaves of C. thyrsoides wither over winter and
	so size cannot be measured in the year of flowering. We therefore
	extended the existing IPM framework to incorporate an additional
	time delay that arises because flowering demography must be predicted
	from rosette size in the year before flowering. 4. We found that
	all main demographic functions (growth, survival probability, flowering
	probability and fecundity) were strongly size-dependent and there
	was a pronounced threshold size of flowering. There was good agreement

  abstract   = {The coexistence of multiple seed size strategies within plant communities
	have been considered puzzling, based on a theoretical expectation
	of the existence of an optimal seed size under each set of specific
	environmental conditions. A model aimed at explaining the coexistence
	of different seed sizes has been suggested, where a seed size â€“
	seed number tradeoff is connected to a tradeoff between competition
	and colonization, leading to a competitive advantage in larger-seeded
	species and a colonization advantage in smaller-seeded species. Recently
	an alternative model has been suggested, based on a tradeoff between
	stress tolerance and fecundity, associated with the variation from
	large to small seeds. Here, we examine the role of seed size for
	recruitment in two-species contests subjected to various treatments.
	In a garden experiment seeds of 14 plant species were combined pair-wise
	into seven pairs, each with one larger-seeded species and one smaller-seeded
	species. Each species-pair was sown with sparse and dense seed densities
	and subjected to different treatments of shading and litter. Recruitment
	was recorded during two years. Our results showed a general advantage
	of larger-seeded species over smaller-seeded species. This seed size
	advantage increased in treatments with litter, whereas there were
	minor effects of shade, and no effect of seed density was found.
	We thus found little support for a density dependent seed size game
	as assumed in models of a competition-colonization tradeoff, whereas
	our results fit well with a model based on a tradeoff between stress
	tolerance and fecundity. Our experiment provides novel empirical
	data to theoretical models on co-existence between multiple seed
	size strategies.},

	2. We used long-term data from annually mapped permanent quadrats
	in a Kansas, USA, grassland to estimate survival, life expectancy
	and life span for 29 perennial forbs (herbaceous dicots) and 11 perennial
	grasses. In the cases of both forbs and grasses, they were the most
	common species at the research site.
	
	3. We developed computer programs to track the identity of individual
	genets based on their spatial locations in the permanent quadrats.
	The programs distinguished between new recruits and surviving individuals,
	and calculated the ages and life spans of the survivors.
	
	4. Most herbaceous perennials die young; life expectancy at age 1
	year ranged from 0.6 to 6.5. However, forbs are more likely to die
	young than grasses. Survival from age 1 to 2 years for forbs ranged
	from 0.11 to 0.49 with an average of 0.30, whereas for grasses it
	ranged from 0.30 to 0.63 with an average of 0.44. Maximum observed
	life spans ranged from 3 to 25 years for forbs and 5 to 39 years
	for grasses.
	
	5. All species tended towards Type III survivorship curves, but grasses
	were more strongly Type III while many forbs had relatively constant
	survival rates with age. Therefore, population models must account
	for increasing survival with age, especially for grasses.
	
	6. Age was a better predictor of grass survival than size, raising
	questions about the use of size-based methods to indirectly estimate
	survival and life span.
	
	7. Maximum observed life span was positively and significantly related
	with species importance.
	
	8. Synthesis. The higher survival, life expectancy and life span of
	grasses compared to forbs may provide a demographic explanation for
	community-level differences in the dominance and turnover of these
	two functional groups in grassland plant communities.}

  abstract = {In many species-rich hay meadows in Central Europe, the traditional
	extensive (low input, low output) management is no longer economical
	and meadows are either fertilized or abandoned. Both these practices
	lead to changes in species composition and usually to a loss in species
	diversity. The response of a species-rich meadow plant community
	to fertilization, mowing and removal of dominant species was studied
	in a manipulative factorial experiment over four years. Both species
	richness and seedling recruitment were positively influenced by mowing
	and to a lesser extent by removal of the dominant species, Molinia
	caerulea, and were negatively influenced by fertilization. Fertilization
	caused an immediate increase in community biomass. Response to removal
	of the dominant species was delayed by one season, continued over
	the whole period, and by the fourth year the biomass reached a similar
	value as in the plots with Molinia present. Changes in species composition
	were evaluated by RDA for repeated measurements. The best and only
	significant predictor of species response to fertilization was plant
	height. This shows that with increased nutrient availability, nutrient
	limitation weakens and competition for light becomes the decisive
	factor. Competition for light appears to be more asymmetric than
	competition for nutrients, and consequently, it is more likely to
	drive inferior species to extinction. This is, together with seedling
	recruitment limitations, the most important cause of a decrease in
	species richness under high nutrient levels. [References: 57]}

  abstract = {Fluctuating environmental conditions are thought to be important for
	the maintenance of species diversity, and yet our understanding of
	the relative contribution of different fluctuation-dependent coexistence
	mechanisms (the temporal storage effect and relative nonlinearity
	of competition) in real systems is limited. Using experiments and
	simulations, we show that both mechanisms consistently affect coexistence
	and that, contrary to long-held assumptions, the effect of relative
	nonlinearity can be larger in magnitude. These results may be general
	in that the simultaneous emergence of both mechanisms rests on two
	factors common to nearly all ecological systems, from the human gut
	to the soil microbiome: variable environmental conditions and saturating
	population growth rates.Understanding the origins and maintenance
	of biodiversity remains one of biology{\textquoteright}s grand challenges.
	From theory and observational evidence, we know that variability
	in environmental conditions through time is likely critical to the
	coexistence of competing species. Nevertheless, experimental tests
	of fluctuation-driven coexistence are rare and have typically focused
	on just one of two potential mechanisms, the temporal storage effect,
	to the neglect of the theoretically equally plausible mechanism known
	as relative nonlinearity of competition. We combined experiments
	and simulations in a system of nectar yeasts to quantify the relative
	contribution of the two mechanisms to coexistence. Resource competition
	models parameterized from single-species assays predicted the outcomes
	of mixed-culture competition experiments with 83\% accuracy. Model
	simulations revealed that both mechanisms have measurable effects
	on coexistence and that relative nonlinearity can be equal or greater
	in magnitude to the temporal storage effect. In addition, we show
	that their effect on coexistence can be both antagonistic and complementary.
	These results falsify the common assumption that relative nonlinearity
	is of negligible importance, and in doing so reveal the importance
	of testing coexistence mechanisms in combination.},

  journal = {Journal of Ecology},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {99},

  number = {2},
  abstract = {1. Maintaining viable populations in different habitats requires physiological,
	morphological and demographic adaptations of plants. In sandland
	environments, plants experience substantial variation in growing
	conditions during the dune fixation process, with high sand mobility
	in early stages and denser vegetation cover in later stages. 2. We
	studied the changes in demography of a dominant shrub, Artemisia
	ordosica, at three stages of dune fixation: semi-fixed dunes, fixed
	dunes and fixed dunes covered with microbiotic crust. Demographic
	data from three annual censuses were used to parameterize integral
	projection models (IPMs) to conduct comparative demographic analyses.
	3. Plant growth and reproduction decreased strongly as dunes became
	more fixed. Shrinkage in plant height occurred very frequently, particularly
	in the fixed dunes with microbiotic crust. Population growth rate
	(lambda) declined substantially with dune fixation: from rapid expansion
	in semi-fixed dunes (lambda = 1.35-1.09) to moderate decline in fixed
	dunes with microbiotic crust (lambda = 0.94-0.89). 4. Elasticity
	analysis revealed that survival was a key vital rate for population
	growth in all habitats. Growth and fecundity were of higher importance
	in the semi-fixed habitat than in the other two habitats where shrinkage
	became an important factor determining lambda. Seedlings and small
	plants were critical for population growth in semi-fixed dunes, whereas
	moderate to large-sized plants were most important in the other habitats.
	5. Results of life table response experiments showed that the observed
	strong decrease in lambda during dune fixation was mainly caused
	by reduction in fecundity, but with additional and considerable contributions
	from reduced plant growth and increased occurrence of shrinkage.
	Thus, populations in semi-fixed dunes are able to expand rapidly
	due to a much higher fecundity compared to those in other habitats.
	6. Synthesis. Artemisia ordosica adopts different life history strategies
	along the dune fixation process. Fast expansion in semi-fixed dunes
	is enabled by high seed production and effective recruitment, while
	populations at later dune fixation stages are maintained through
	frequent plant shrinkage. Integral projection models are highly appropriate
	tools for analysing such life history changes as they are based on
	statistical comparisons of vital rates across habitats.},

  abstract  = {Terrestrial ecosystems sequester roughly 30\% of anthropogenic carbon
	emission. However this estimate has not been directly deduced from
	studies of terrestrial ecosystems themselves, but inferred from atmospheric
	and oceanic data. This raises a question: to what extent is the terrestrial
	carbon cycle intrinsically predictable? In this paper, we investigated
	fundamental properties of the terrestrial carbon cycle, examined
	its intrinsic predictability, and proposed a suite of future research
	directions to improve empirical understanding and model predictive
	ability. Specifically, we isolated endogenous internal processes
	of the terrestrial carbon cycle from exogenous forcing variables.
	The internal processes share five fundamental properties (i.e., compartmentalization,
	carbon input through photosynthesis, partitioning among pools, donor
	pool-dominant transfers, and the first-order decay) among all types
	of ecosystems on the Earth. The five properties together result in
	an emergent constraint on predictability of various carbon cycle
	components in response to five classes of exogenous forcing. Future
	observational and experimental research should be focused on those
	less predictive components while modeling research needs to improve
	model predictive ability for those highly predictive components.
	We argue that an understanding of predictability should provide guidance
	on future observational, experimental and modeling research.},

	413 413 References 414 Summary Models describing the biotic drivers
	that create and maintain biological diversity within trophic levels
	have focused primarily on negative interactions (i.e. competition),
	leaving marginal room for positive interactions (i.e. facilitation).
	We show facilitation to be a ubiquitous driver of biodiversity by
	first noting that all species use resources and thus change the local
	biotic or abiotic conditions, altering the available multidimensional
	niches. This can cause a shift in local species composition, which
	can cause an increase in beta, and sometimes alpha, diversity. We
	show that these increases are ubiquitous across ecosystems. These
	positive effects on diversity occur via a broad host of disparate
	direct and indirect mechanisms. We identify and unify several of
	these facilitative mechanisms and discuss why it has been easy to
	underappreciate the importance of facilitation. We show that net
	positive effects have a long history of being considered ecologically
	or evolutionarily unstable, and we present recent evidence of its
	potential stability. Facilitation goes well beyond the common case
	of stress amelioration and it probably gains importance as community
	complexity increases. While biodiversity is, in part, created by
	species exploiting many niches, many niches are available to exploit
	only because species create them.},

	a major impact on the evolutionarily stable reproductive strategy
	by altering fecundity schedules in a size-dependent manner. We explored

	using two years of data from the South of France. An integral projection
	model based on detailed statistical models of the demography of Carduus
	nutans and characteristics of herbivore attack showed that seed predators
	select for smaller flowering size. An elasticity analysis showed
	that changes in the slope relating seed herbivore attack rates to
	plant total receptacle area had a large effect on lifetime reproductive
	success relative to most other plant demographic rates. Together,
	these two results indicate that in the absence of seed predators,
	as is the case in the exotic range of this invasive species, flowering
	size could evolve to be larger. Further analysis also showed that
	subsequent introduction of different species of seed-feeders as biocontrol
	agents could lead to different evolutionary outcomes dependent on
	the ecological characteristics of the seed-feeders, allowing the
	direction and magnitude of evolutionary change in flowering size
	to be predicted based on what seed predators have been introduced
	where and when. Such data would allow us to distinguish between the

	systematic spatial variation in chronic insect herbivory limits the
	tree cholla distribution to a subset of suitable habitat across the
	gradient. Our results support this hypothesis. We found that key
	demographic functions (survival, growth, fecundity) and the responses
	of these functions to experimental reductions in insect herbivory
	varied across the gradient. The effects of insect exclusion on plant
	growth and seed production were strongest in the low-elevation grassland
	and decreased in magnitude with increasing elevation. We used the
	experimental data to parameterize integral projection models (IPM),
	which predict the asymptotic rate of population increase (lambda).
	The modeling results showed that insect herbivory depressed lambda
	and that the magnitude of this effect was context-dependent. The
	effect of insect herbivory on population growth was strongest at
	low elevation (Delta lambda(low) = 0.095), intermediate at mid elevation
	(Delta lambda(mid) = 0.046), and weakest at high elevation (Delta
	lambda(high) = -0.0089). The total effect of insects on lambda was
	due to a combination of reductions in growth and in fecundity and
	their combination; the relative contribution of each of these effects
	varied spatially. Our results, generated by experimental demography
	across a heterogeneous landscape, provide new insights into the role
	of native consumers in the population dynamics and distribution of
	abundance of long-lived native plants.},

	range of data types and are therefore widely used in applications.
	A key part in the analysis of data is model selection, which often
	aims to choose a parsimonious model with other desirable properties
	from a possibly. very large set of candidate statistical models.
	Over the last 5-10 years the literature on model selection in linear
	mixed models has grown extremely rapidly. The problem is much more
	complicated than in linear regression because selection on the covariance
	structure is not straightforward due to computational issues and
	boundary problems arising from positive semidefinite constraints
	on covariance matrices. To obtain a better understanding of the available
	methods, their properties and the relationships between them, we
	review a large body of literature on linear mixed model selection.
	We arrange, implement, discuss and compare model selection methods
	based on four major approaches: infoimation criteria such as AIC
	or BIC, shrinkage methods based on penalized loss functions such
	as LASSO, the Fence procedure and Bayesian techniques.},

	understanding the genetic basis of disease, the threat posed by declining

	however, because new mutations are rare. Mutation accumulation (MA)
	experiments overcome this by allowing mutations to build up over
	many generations in the near absence of natural selection. Here,
	we sequenced the genomes of 85 MA lines derived from six genetically
	diverse strains of the green alga Chlamydomonas rein hardtii We identified
	6843 new mutations, more than any other study of spontaneous mutation.
	We observed sevenfold variation in the mutation rate among strains
	and that mutator genotypes arose, increasing the mutation rate approximately
	eightfold in some replicates. We also found evidence for fine-scale
	heterogeneity in the mutation rate, with certain sequence motifs
	mutating at much higher rates, and clusters of multiple mutations
	occurring at closely linked sites. There was little evidence, however,
	for mutation rate heterogeneity between chromosomes or over large
	genomic regions of 200 kbp. We generated a predictive model of the
	mutability of sites based on their genomic properties, including
	local GC content, gene expression level, and local sequence context.
	Our model accurately predicted the average mutation rate and natural
	levels of genetic diversity of sites across the genome. Notably,
	trinucleotides vary 17-fold in rate between the most and least mutable
	sites. Our results uncover a rich heterogeneity in the process of
	spontaneous mutation both among individuals and across the genome.}},

	and mathematical approaches in the simpler situations. The more outstanding
	conclusions are listed below. Populations are self-governing systems.
	They regulate their densities in relation to their own properties
	and those of their environments. This they do by depleting and impairing
	essential things to the threshold of favourability, or by maintaining
	reactive inimical factors, such as the attack of natural enemies,
	at the limit of tolerance. The mechanism of density governance is
	almost always intraspecific competition, either amongst the animals
	for a critically important requisite, or amongst natural enemies
	for which the animals concerned are requisites. Governing reaction
	induced by density change holds populations in a state of balance
	in their environments. The characteristic of balance is sustained
	and effective compensatory reaction which maintains populations in
	being in spite of even violent changes in the environment, and which
	adjusts their densities in general conformity with prevailing conditions.
	Far from being a stationary state, balance is commonly a state of
	oscillation about the level of the equilibrium density which is for
	ever changing with environmental conditions. Destructive factors
	do not add to mortality when they continue to operate over long periods,
	but merely cause a redistribution of mortality, for the intensity
	of competition automatically relaxes sufficiently to make room for
	the destruction they cause. Such compensatory reaction causes the
	effect of destructive factors upon density to be much less when balance
	is reattained than that which they produce when they first operate.},

	and population dynamics of many species(1,2). However, the links
	underlying these joint responses remain largely unknown owing to
	a paucity of long-term data and the lack of an appropriate analytical
	framework(3). Here we investigate the link between phenotypic and
	demographic responses to environmental change using a new methodology
	and a long-term (1976-2008) data set from a hibernating mammal (the
	yellow-bellied marmot) inhabiting a dynamic subalpine habitat. We
	demonstrate how earlier emergence from hibernation and earlier weaning
	of young has led to a longer growing season and larger body masses
	before hibernation. The resulting shift in both the phenotype and
	the relationship between phenotype and fitness components led to
	a decline in adult mortality, which in turn triggered an abrupt increase
	in population size in recent years. Direct and trait-mediated effects
	of environmental change made comparable contributions to the observed
	marked increase in population growth. Our results help explain how
	a shift in phenology can cause simultaneous phenotypic and demographic
	changes, and highlight the need for a theory integrating ecological
	and evolutionary dynamics in stochastic environments(4,5).},

  abstract = {Environmental change continually perturbs populations from a stable
	state, leading to transient dynamics that can last multiple generations.
	Several long-term studies have reported changes in trait distributions
	along with demographic response to environmental change. Here we
	conducted an experimental study on soil mites and investigated the
	interaction between demography and an individual trait over a period
	of nonstationary dynamics. By following individual fates and body
	sizes at each life-history stage, we investigated how body size and
	population density influenced demographic rates. By comparing the
	ability of two alternative approaches, a matrix projection model
	and an integral projection model, we investigated whether consideration
	of trait-based demography enhances our ability to predict transient
	dynamics. By utilizing a prospective perturbation analysis, we addressed
	which stage-specific demographic or trait-transition rate had the
	greatest influence on population dynamics. Both body size and population
	density had important effects on most rates; however, these effects
	differed substantially among life-history stages. Considering the
	observed trait-demography relationships resulted in better predictions
	of a population's response to perturbations, which highlights the
	role of phenotypic plasticity in transient dynamics. Although the
	perturbation analyses provided comparable predictions of stage-specific
	elasticities between the matrix and integral projection models, the
	order of importance of the life-history stages differed between the
	two analyses. In conclusion, we demonstrate how a trait-based demographic
	approach provides further insight into transient population dynamics.},

	heterogeneity in forests have large effects on system-level properties
	such as standing crop, and on community-level properties such as
	successional species turnover. A `'mean field'' version of the forest
	simulation model SORTIE is developed in which horizontal spatial
	heterogeneity is eliminated while vertical structure is retained.
	The mean-field model maintains only approximately one half the standing
	crop and looses successional diversity approximately twice as fast
	as the full spatial model. Data from natural stands support the spatial
	model. A partial differential equation limit of the mean-field simulator
	is also derived. The results are set in the context of ongoing efforts
	to develop models intended to predict the biosphere's response to
	global change. The importance of processes governing fine-scale spatial
	heterogeneity implies that biospheric models will agree with nature
	only ii they are phenomenological (e.g. fitted to data) at large
	scale, or if spatial scaling rules are discovered that allow one
	to derive system-level properties from individual-level processes.},

  abstract = {The perfect-plasticity approximation (PPA) is an analytically tractable
	model of forest dynamics, defined in terms of parameters for individual
	trees, including allometry, growth, and mortality. We estimated these
	parameters for the eight most common species on each of four soil
	types in the US Lake states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota)
	by using short-term (<= 15-year) inventory data from individual trees.
	We implemented 100-year PPA simulations given these parameters and
	compared these predictions to chronosequences of stand development.
	Predictions for the timing and magnitude of basal area dynamics and
	ecological succession on each soil were accurate, and predictions
	for the diameter distribution of 100-year-old stands were correct
	in form and slope. For a given species, the PPA provides analytical
	metrics for early-successional performance (H-20, height of a 20-year-old
	open-grown tree) and late-successional performance (Z{*}, equilibrium
	canopy height in monoculture). These metrics predicted which species
	were early or late successional on each soil type. Decomposing Z{*}
	showed that (i) succession is driven both by superior understory
	performance and superior canopy performance of late-successional
	species, and (h) performance differences primarily reflect differences
	in mortality rather than growth. The predicted late-successional
	dominants matched chronosequences on xeromesic (Quercus rubra) and
	mesic (codominance by Acer rubrum and Acer saccharum) soil. On hydromesic
	and hydric soils, the literature reports that the current dominant
	species in old stands (Thuja occidentalis) is now failing to regenerate.
	Consistent with this, the PPA predicted that, on these soils, stands
	are now succeeding to dominance by other late-successional species
	(e.g., Fraxinus nigra, A. rubrum).},

	biosphere, and there have been substantial efforts to understand
	why growth varies among species. To this end, a large number of experimental
	analyses have been undertaken; however, the emergent patterns between
	growth rate and its components are often contradictory. We believe
	that these conflicting results are a consequence of the way growth
	is measured. Growth is typically characterized by relative growth
	rate (RGR); however, RGR often declines as organisms get larger,
	making it difficult to compare species of different sizes. To overcome
	this problem, we advocate using nonlinear mixed-effects models so
	that RGR can be calculated at a standard size, and we present easily
	implemented methods for doing this. We then present new methods for
	analyzing the traditional components of RGR that explicitly allow
	for the fact that log (RGR) is the sum of its components. These methods
	provide an exact decomposition of the variance in log (RGR). Finally,
	we use simple analytical and simulation approaches to explore the
	effect of size variation on growth and its components and show that
	the relative importance of the components of RGR is influenced by
	the extent to which analyses standardize for plant size.},

  abstract = {1. The conventional explanations for large plant species producing
	larger seeds on average than small plant species have recently been
	challenged, and it has been suggested that the pattern is better
	explained by the theory developed by Charnov (1993). Here we use
	simple life-history theory to explore the logic underlying Charnov's
	models and show that under most reasonable conditions they predict
	no relationship between seed mass and size at maturity. 2. Using
	a simple general model incorporating size-specific growth and survival,
	we explore the joint evolution of seed mass and size at maturity,
	and argue that seed mass will be correlated with adult traits, such
	as the timing of reproduction and size at reproduction, only if seedling
	and adult growth and mortality rates are correlated. Evidence for
	such correlations is briefly explored. 3. It has also been suggested
	that the standard model for seed mass evolution (Smith & Fretwell
	1974) has been misinterpreted, and that application of the model
	requires measurement of survivorship to reproductive maturity. Using
	a simple model incorporating size-specific growth and survival we
	show that this criticism is unfounded. 4. Our results differ from
	those of Moles and colleagues because they look at the effect of
	long juvenile period on survival to maturity, but do not recognize
	that this may be compensated by covarying life-history traits, such
	as plant size and reproductive lifespan. Also, they seem to argue
	that life-history evolution is constrained by cross-angiosperm correlations,
	such as that between seed mass and longevity, while the life-history
	models presented here seek selective causes of such correlations,
	rather than regarding them as constraints. 5. Models similar to those
	of Charnov (1993) only predict a positive relationship between seed
	size and plant size if unrealistic assumptions are made about the
	effects of seed mass on survival, such as the effect of seed mass
	on instantaneous survival persisting to adulthood.},

  abstract = {{Threshold traits are characterized by showing discrete phenotypes
	(typically two) but by being controlled by many loci of small additive
	effect, the expression of the phenotype being a consequence of a
	threshold of sensitivity. In the case of a dimorphic threshold trait,
	individuals above the threshold display one morph and individuals
	below the threshold display the alternate. Many threshold traits,
	such as sex ratio, cyclomorphosis, paedomorphosis and wing dimorphism,
	are closely connected to fitness but have high heritabilities. The
	present study investigates the hypothesis that these large heritabilities
	can be maintained even in the face of directional selection by the
	countervailing force of mutation. This hypothesis is based on the
	observation that as selection proceeds to shift the frequency of
	one morph towards fixation, the selection intensity necessarily declines
	permitting mutation to restore genetic variation. The hypothesis
	is tested using a simulation model and a theoretical analysis, the
	latter assuming no genetic drift. It is shown that over 80 per cent
	of the original genetic variance can be maintained at equilibrium
	provided the population (N) and number of loci (n) are reasonably
	large (N>5000, n = 50). However, unless the selection coefficient
	is very small (<0.001) the equilibrium frequency of the phenotypes
	(<2 per cent) is considerably below that generally observed. I conclude
	that mutation could play a significant role in the maintenance of
	genetic variation in threshold traits but that some form of selection,
	such as frequency-dependent selection, is required to maintain the
	phenotypic variation.}},

	(1) does insect herbivory reduce plant population growth rate (lambda),
	(2) does the effect on (lambda) differ between productivity zones,
	(3) does it primarily operate by limiting growth or fecundity and
	(4) is there evidence for density dependence in mediating impact

	vary with ecosystem productivity. Insect herbivores' effect on lambda
	arose primarily through suppression of fecundity. We found no evidence

	the most commonly used class of models in statistical applications.
	It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized)
	additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric
	regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes
	and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate
	Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression
	models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian,
	controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response
	variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form
	owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov
	chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without
	problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In
	some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such
	that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate
	tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested
	Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly
	compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals.
	The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where
	Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our
	approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes.
	Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes
	it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined
	way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive
	measures so that models can be compared and the model under study
	can be challenged.},

  abstract = {{The open-data scientific philosophy is being widely adopted and proving
	to promote considerable progress in ecology and evolution. Open-data
	global data bases now exist on animal migration, species distribution,
	conservation status, etc. However, a gap exists for data on population
	dynamics spanning the rich diversity of the animal kingdom world-wide.
	This information is fundamental to our understanding of the conditions
	that have shaped variation in animal life histories and their relationships
	with the environment, as well as the determinants of invasion and
	extinction. Matrix population models (MPMs) are among the most widely
	used demographic tools by animal ecologists. MPMs project population
	dynamics based on the reproduction, survival and development of individuals
	in a population over their life cycle. The outputs from MPMs have
	direct biological interpretations, facilitating comparisons among
	animal species as different as Caenorhabditis elegans, Loxodonta
	africana and Homo sapiens. Thousands of animal demographic records
	exist in the form of MPMs, but they are dispersed throughout the
	literature, rendering comparative analyses difficult. Here, we introduce
	the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database, an open-data online repository,
	which in its version 1.0.0 contains data on 345 species world-wide,
	from 402 studies with a total of 1625 population projection matrices.
	COMADRE also contains ancillary information (e.g. ecoregion, taxonomy,
	biogeography, etc.) that facilitates interpretation of the numerous
	demographic metrics that can be derived from its MPMs. We provide
	R code to some of these examples.Synthesis: We introduce the COMADRE
	Animal Matrix Database, a resource for animal demography. Its open-data
	nature, together with its ancillary information, will facilitate
	comparative analysis, as will the growing availability of databases
	focusing on other aspects of the rich animal diversity, and tools
	to query and combine them. Through future frequent updates of COMADRE,
	and its integration with other online resources, we encourage animal
	ecologists to tackle global ecological and evolutionary questions
	with unprecedented sample size.}},

	traits. Data on how these traits vary among species and populations
	are fundamental to our understanding of the ecological conditions
	that have shaped plant evolution. Because these demographic schedules
	determine population growth or decline, such data help us understand
	how different biomes shape plant ecology, how plant populations and
	communities respond to global change and how to develop successful
	management tools for endangered or invasive species. 2. Matrix population
	models summarize the life cycle components of survival, growth and
	reproduction, while explicitly acknowledging heterogeneity among
	classes of individuals in the population. Matrix models have comparable
	structures, and their emergent measures of population dynamics, such
	as population growth rate or mean life expectancy, have direct biological
	interpretations, facilitating comparisons among populations and species.
	3. Thousands of plant matrix population models have been parameterized
	from empirical data, but they are largely dispersed through peer-reviewed

	and a dwindling resource, but how the large numbers of species that
	characterize such communities are able to coexist is poorly understood.
	Resource-based competition theory predicts that stable coexistence
	between species depends on each being a superior competitor in its
	own niche(1). The theoretical problem is that plants all require
	the same resources and acquire them in a very limited variety of
	ways, so observed niche overlaps are high(2,3) and exclusion of all
	but the best competitor is the predicted result. This problem, central
	to community ecology, has elicited a variety of theoretical solutions(4-7),
	several of which invoke some degree of niche separation in time or
	space(8,9). The signature of niche separation in the field is to
	be found in community structure, which should indicate (i) smaller
	than expected niche overlaps on relevant niche axes and (ii) a trade-off
	between species' resource use on orthogonal axes. Here we provide
	evidence for the existence of both these conditions in a species-rich
	plant community. [References: 20]},

	especially for organisms that die following a single reproductive
	episode, such as the monocarp Lobelia inflata. The propensity to
	initiate flowering (to bolt) under a given set of conditions is expected
	to be shaped by natural selection acting on the norms of reaction
	for bolting behaviour over, for example, changing photoperiods. We
	study the genetic basis of bolting and of the plasticity of bolting
	using three continuously changing photoperiod regimes over two generations
	in a growth chamber experiment. Multiple genotypes from three populations
	are tested under three different photoperiod treatments mimicking
	early, mid, and late `summer' during both generations. The frequency
	of bolting ranges from 88\% under long days to 1\% under short days.
	The overall heritability (h(2)) of bolting is found to be high, and
	increases later in the flowering season. Genetic variance for bolting
	is explained by genetic variance for threshold size itself, rather
	than for capacity to attain a fixed threshold size: genotypes that
	bolt most readily tend to be those that bolt at a smaller rosette
	size. No significant heritability of the plasticity of bolting behaviour
	is detected. Similarly to within populations, variation at the among-population
	level exists for bolting behaviour. There is no evidence for genetic
	population differentiation with respect to plasticity for bolting:

	and direction at different stages of the life cycle. In monocarpic
	perennials, however, it is often assumed that recruitment is the
	stage most affected by density. The spatial pattern of newly emerged
	individuals of the facultative biennial Digitalis purpurea was recorded
	and followed in five 0.5-m(2) plots censused twice during each of
	three seasons. To examine effects of local density on growth and
	survival, a plant's neighbourhood was defined as the number of individuals
	inside a circle of fixed radius around it. Species identity of the
	nearest neighbour was established to see whether the effects of intra-
	and interspecific interactions differed. Relative growth rate (RGR)
	was negatively related to local density during both of the first
	two summers, but not during winter. In 1998 the negative effects
	were stronger when the closest neighbour was conspecific. Contrasting
	patterns of size-dependent growth were found during summer and winter,
	with summer RGR an increasing, and winter RGR a decreasing, function
	of size. Summer survival was generally high, and was positively related
	to spring size. There was a significant negative effect of increasing
	local density on survival probability in 1998. No effect of neighbour
	identity was detected. Winter survival was low, and mainly dependent
	on autumn size, with no significant effects of local density in any
	season. During the first winter, individuals with a conspecific as
	the nearest neighbour had lower survival probabilities. There was
	no evidence of a tradeoff between summer RGR and survival probability.
	Density-dependent effects may be significant beyond the recruitment
	stage in monocarpic perennials such as D. purpurea. Density dependence
	was strongest at early life stages although, because effects on growth
	persisted into the second year, it is likely that local density may
	influence timing of reproduction in this population. The use of detailed
	studies investigating the timing and magnitude of density dependence
	across the entire life cycle may provide new insight into life history
	evolution.},

	a model of competing annual plants, we find that variable germination
	(and hence a storage effect) can evolve only if germination is positively
	correlated with high-fecundity years (predictive germination) or
	if one species has limited ability to evolve. Outside of these conditions,
	the storage effect is evolutionarily unstable: if two species were
	thrown together with traits that would permit a storage effect, they
	would coevolve constant germination rates and the storage effect
	would vanish. Our results suggest that for the temporal storage effect
	to be widespread, either germination must commonly be positively

	a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual
	observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic
	plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding P-D to the posterior
	mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing
	models, which is related to other information criteria and has an
	approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated
	in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian
	and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities

	phenotypic correlation. We also show how population structure can
	affect dispersion in reproduction among ages and stages. These macroscopic

  abstract = {{Phenotypic variation within populations has two sources: genetic
	variation and environmental variation. Here, we investigate the coevolution
	of these two components under fluctuating selection. Our analysis
	is based on the lottery model in which genetic polymorphism can be
	maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection, whereas environmental
	variation can be favored due to bet-hedging. In our model, phenotypes
	are characterized by a quantitative trait under stabilizing selection
	with the optimal phenotype fluctuating in time. Genotypes are characterized
	by their phenotypic offspring distribution, which is assumed to be
	Gaussian with heritable variation for its mean and variance. Polymorphism
	in the mean corresponds to genetic variance while the width of the
	offspring distribution corresponds to environmental variance. We
	show that increased environmental variance is favored whenever fluctuations
	in the selective optima are sufficiently strong. Given the environmental
	variance has evolved to its optimum, genetic polymorphism can still
	emerge if the distribution of selective optima is sufficiently asymmetric
	or leptokurtic. Polymorphism evolves in a diagonal direction in trait
	space: one type becomes a canalized specialist for the more common
	ecological conditions and the other type a de-canalized bet-hedger
	thriving on the less-common conditions. All results are based on
	analytical approximations, complemented by individual-based simulations.}},

	predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower
	in subjects <70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in
	the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results
	obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using
	the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE
	exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied
	by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted
	in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other
	criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to
	those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption
	of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive
	results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant
	reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results
	confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

  abstract = {{We develop a general population genetic framework for analyzing selection
	on many loci, and apply it to strong truncation and disruptive selection
	on an additive polygenic trait. We first present statistical methods
	for analyzing the infinitesimal model, in which offspring breeding
	values are normally distributed around the mean of the parents, with
	fixed variance. These show that the usual assumption of a Gaussian
	distribution of breeding values in the population gives remarkably
	accurate predictions for the mean and the variance, even when disruptive
	selection generates substantial deviations from normality. We then
	set out a general genetic analysis of selection and recombination.
	The population is represented by multilocus cumulants describing
	the distribution of haploid genotypes, and selection is described
	by the relation between mean fitness and these cumulants. We provide
	exact recursions in terms of generating functions for the effects
	of selection on non-central moments. The effects of recombination
	are simply calculated as a weighted sum over all the permutations
	produced by meiosis. Finally, the new cumulants that describe the
	next generation are computed from the non-central moments. Although
	this scheme is applied here in detail only to selection on an additive
	trait, it is quite general. For arbitrary epistasis and linkage,
	we describe a consistent infinitesimal limit in which the short-term
	selection response is dominated by infinitesimal allele frequency
	changes and linkage disequilibria. Numerical multilocus results show
	that the standard Gaussian approximation gives accurate predictions
	for the dynamics of the mean and genetic variance in this limit.
	Even with intense truncation selection, linkage disequilibria of
	order three and higher never cause much deviation from normality.
	Thus, the empirical deviations frequently found between predicted
	and observed responses to artificial selection are not caused by
	linkage-disequilibrium-induced departures from normality. Disruptive
	selection can generate substantial four-way disequilibria, and hence
	kurtosis; but even then, the Gaussian assumption predicts the variance
	accurately. In contrast to the apparent simplicity of the infinitesimal
	limit, data suggest that changes in genetic variance after 10 or
	more generations of selection are likely to be dominated by allele
	frequency dynamics that depend on genetic details.}},

  abstract  = {The tropical forests of Borneo and Amazonia may each contain more
	tree species diversity in half a square kilometre than do all the
	temperate forests of Europe, North America, and Asia combined. Biologists
	have long been fascinated by this disparity, using it to investigate
	potential drivers of biodiversity. Latitudinal variation in many
	of these drivers is expected to create geographic differences in
	ecological and evolutionary processes, and evidence increasingly
	shows that tropical ecosystems have higher rates of diversification,
	clade origination, and clade dispersal. However, there is currently
	no evidence to link gradients in ecological processes within communities
	at a local scale directly to the geographic gradient in biodiversity.
	Here, we show geographic variation in the storage effect, an ecological
	mechanism that reduces the potential for competitive exclusion more
	strongly in the tropics than it does in temperate and boreal zones,
	decreasing the ratio of interspecific-to-intraspecific competition
	by 0.25\% for each degree of latitude that an ecosystem is located
	closer to the Equator. Additionally, we find evidence that latitudinal
	variation in climate underpins these differences; longer growing
	seasons in the tropics reduce constraints on the seasonal timing
	of reproduction, permitting lower recruitment synchrony between species
	and thereby enhancing niche partitioning through the storage effect.
	Our results demonstrate that the strength of the storage effect,
	and therefore its impact on diversity within communities, varies
	latitudinally in association with climate. This finding highlights
	the importance of biotic interactions in shaping geographic diversity
	patterns, and emphasizes the need to understand the mechanisms underpinning
	ecological processes in greater detail than has previously been appreciated.},

  abstract = {Variation in organismal development is ubiquitous in nature but omitted
	from most age-and stage-structured population models. I give a general
	approach for formulating and analyzing its role in density-independent
	population models using the framework of integral projection models.
	The approach allows flexible assumptions, including correlated development
	times among multiple life stages. I give a new Monte Carlo numerical
	integration approach to calculate long-term growth rate, its sensitivities,
	stable age-stage distributions and reproductive value. This method
	requires only simulations of individual life schedules, rather than
	iteration of full population dynamics, and has practical and theoretical
	appeal because it ties easily implemented simulations to numerical
	solution of demographic equations. I show that stochastic development
	is demographically important using two examples. For a desert cactus,
	many stochastic development models, with independent or correlated
	stage durations, can generate the same stable stage distribution
	(SSD) as the real data, but stable age-within-stage distributions
	and sensitivities of growth rate to demographic rates differ greatly
	among stochastic development scenarios. For Mediterranean fruit flies,
	empirical variation in maturation time has a large impact on population
	growth. The systematic model formulation and analysis approach given
	here should make consideration of variable development models widely
	accessible and readily extendible.},

  abstract  = {A plethora of different theories, models, and concepts make up the
	field of community ecology. Amid this vast body of work, is it possible
	to build one general theory of ecological communities? What other
	scientific areas might serve as a guiding framework? As it turns
	out, the core focus of community ecology--understanding patterns
	of diversity and composition of biological variants across space
	and time--is shared by evolutionary biology and its very coherent
	conceptual framework, population genetics theory. The Theory of Ecological
	Communities takes this as a starting point to pull together community
	ecology's various perspectives into a more unified whole. Mark Vellend
	builds a theory of ecological communities based on four overarching
	processes: selection among species, drift, dispersal, and speciation.
	These are analogues of the four central processes in population genetics
	theory--selection within species, drift, gene flow, and mutation--and
	together they subsume almost all of the many dozens of more specific
	models built to describe the dynamics of communities of interacting
	species. The result is a theory that allows the effects of many low-level
	processes, such as competition, facilitation, predation, disturbance,
	stress, succession, colonization, and local extinction to be understood
	as the underpinnings of high-level processes with widely applicable
	consequences for ecological communities. Reframing the numerous existing
	ideas in community ecology, The Theory of Ecological Communities
	provides a new way for thinking about biological composition and
	diversity.},

	previous analyses of evolutionary branching have been conducted in
	an infinitely large population. Here, we study the effect of stochasticity
	caused by the finiteness of the population size on evolutionary branching.
	By analyzing the dynamics of trait variance, we obtain the condition
	for evolutionary branching as the one under which trait variance
	explodes. Genetic drift reduces the trait variance and causes stochastic
	fluctuation. In a very small population, evolutionary branching does
	not occur. In larger populations, evolutionary branching may occur,
	but it occurs in two different manners: in deterministic branching,
	branching occurs quickly when the population reaches the singular
	point, while in stochastic branching, the population stays at singularity
	for a period before branching out. The conditions for these cases

  abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that many facultative biennials
	show variation in threshold size for flowering. In order to quantify
	the genetic variation for this character, we performed a two-way
	artificial selection experiment on threshold size in Cynoglossum
	officinale. The parental generation, established from seed from a
	natural population, showed large variation in threshold sizes (2.6-13.4
	g). After one generation of selection for low threshold sizes all
	plants in the F-1 flowered at sizes below 3.2 g. In the high selection
	line none of the F-1 plants under 3.6 g flowered, and there were
	very large nonflowering plants (up to 17.2 g). By interpreting the
	logistic regression of flowering probability on plant size as a cumulative
	frequency distribution of threshold sizes, we could derive the frequency
	distributions of threshold sizes in each generation. These were used
	to estimate the narrow-sense heritabilities by the standard procedure
	for artificial selection on a quantitative character. This gave `heritabilities'
	of 0.35 and 0.32 for the high and low selection lines, respectively.
	A previously constructed optimization model, applied to the population
	in our study area, predicted strong selection against low threshold
	sizes, but a fairly equal fitness for threshold sizes around and
	above the optimum. This flat fitness profile may explain why the
	natural population of Cynoglossum officinale harbours extensive genetic
	variation for this character.},

  abstract = {Body size is one of the most important traits of organisms and allows
	predictions of an individual's morphology, physiology, behaviour
	and life history. However, explaining the evolution of complex traits
	such as body size is difficult because a plethora of other traits
	influence body size. Here I review what we know about the evolution
	of body size in a group of island reptiles and try to generalize
	about the mechanisms that shape body size. Galapagos marine iguanas
	occupy all 13 larger islands in this Pacific archipelago and have
	maximum island body weights between 900 and 12 000 g. The distribution
	of body sizes does not match mitochondrial clades, indicating that
	body size evolves independently of genetic relatedness. Marine iguanas
	lack intra- and inter-specific food competition and predators are
	not size-specific, discounting these factors as selective agents
	influencing body size. Instead I hypothesize that body size reflects
	the trade-offs between sexual and natural selection. We found that
	sexual selection continuously favours larger body sizes. Large males
	establish display territories and some gain over-proportional reproductive
	success in the iguanas' mating aggregations. Females select males
	based on size and activity and are thus responsible for the observed
	mating skew. However, large individuals are strongly selected against
	during El Nimo-related famines when dietary algae disappear from
	the intertidal foraging areas. We showed that differences in algae
	sward ('pasture') heights and thermal constraints on large size are
	causally responsible for differences in maximum body size among populations.
	I hypothesize that body size in many animal species reflects a trade-off
	between foraging constraints and sexual selection and suggest that
	future research could focus on physiological and genetic mechanisms
	determining body size in wild animals. Furthermore, evolutionary
	stable body size distributions within populations should be analysed
	to better understand selection pressures on individual body size.},

	level declines. We used demographic models to investigate the effects
	of two invasive grasses on the demography and population growth of
	Anemone patens, a long-lived native perennial of North American grasslands.
	Demographic data of A. patens growing in patches characterized by
	Bromus inermis, Poa pratensis, or native grasses were used to parameterize
	integral projection models. Models based on both average conditions
	and those allowing for environmental stochasticity indicate that
	A. patens is slowly increasing in patches of native grass (lambda
	= 1.02) and declining in patches of invasive grasses, particularly
	those dominated by B. inermis (lambda = 0.93). Extinction probabilities
	indicate that A. patens should persist in native grass patches, but
	has a much higher probability of extinction in Bromus patches compared
	to Poa patches. While sensitivity analyses showed that survival had
	the biggest effect on population growth rates in all habitats, results
	of a Life Table Response Experiment (LTRE) revealed that slower individual
	growth rates in patches of invasive grasses contributed the most
	to the observed reduction in population growth. These results suggest
	that invasive grasses may cause slow declines in A. patens, despite

  volume = {114},
  pages = {E9932--E9941},

  abstract = {A key question in evolutionary biology is: What maintains the abundant
	genetic variation observed in natural populations? Many organisms
	experience some seasonality in their habitats, and, if they have
	multiple generations per year, seasonally fluctuating selection is
	a potentially powerful mechanism to maintain polymorphism. However,
	previous research has argued that this occurs rarely. Inspired by
	recent empirical findings, we reevaluate the potential of seasonally
	fluctuating selection to simultaneously maintain polymorphism at
	many loci in the genome. We obtain a more general condition for the
	maintenance of multilocus polymorphism by seasonally fluctuating
	selection. This condition may plausibly be satisfied for many species
	and does not suffer from problems of previous models.Most natural
	populations are affected by seasonal changes in temperature, rainfall,
	or resource availability. Seasonally fluctuating selection could
	potentially make a large contribution to maintaining genetic polymorphism
	in populations. However, previous theory suggests that the conditions
	for multilocus polymorphism are restrictive. Here, we explore a more
	general class of models with multilocus seasonally fluctuating selection
	in diploids. In these models, the multilocus genotype is mapped to
	fitness in two steps. The first mapping is additive across loci and
	accounts for the relative contributions of heterozygous and homozygous
	loci{\textemdash}that is, dominance. The second step uses a nonlinear
	fitness function to account for the strength of selection and epistasis.
	Using mathematical analysis and individual-based simulations, we
	show that stable polymorphism at many loci is possible if currently
	favored alleles are sufficiently dominant. This general mechanism,
	which we call {\textquotedblleft}segregation lift,{\textquotedblright}
	requires seasonal changes in dominance, a phenomenon that may arise
	naturally in situations with antagonistic pleiotropy and seasonal
	changes in the relative importance of traits for fitness. Segregation
	lift works best under diminishing-returns epistasis, is not affected
	by problems of genetic load, and is robust to differences in parameters
	across loci and seasons. Under segregation lift, loci can exhibit
	conspicuous seasonal allele-frequency fluctuations, but often fluctuations
	may be small and hard to detect. An important direction for future
	work is to formally test for segregation lift in empirical data and
	to quantify its contribution to maintaining genetic variation in
	natural populations.},

	estimating additive genetic variation of seed provisioning requires
	complex quantitative genetic approaches for distinguishing between
	true genetic and environmental maternal effects. Here, using Maritime
	pine as a long-lived plant model, we quantified additive genetic
	variation of cone and seed weight (SW) mean and SW within-individual
	variation. We used a powerful approach combining both half-sib analysis
	and parent-offspring regression using several common garden tests
	established in contrasting environments to separate G, E and G x
	E effects. Both cone weight and SW mean showed significant genetic
	variation but were also influenced by the maternal environment. Most
	of the large variation in SW mean was attributable to additive genetic
	effects (h(2) = 0.55-0.74). SW showed no apparent G x E interaction,
	particularly when accounting for cone weight covariation, suggesting
	that the maternal genotypes actively control the SW mean irrespective
	of the amount of resources allocated to cones. Within-individual
	variation in SW was low (12\%) relative to between-individual variation
	(88\%), and showed no genetic variation but was largely affected
	by the maternal environment, with greater variation in the less favourable
	sites for pine growth. In summary, results were very consistent between
	the parental and the offspring common garden tests, and clearly indicated
	heritable genetic variation for SW mean but not for within-individual

	Underestimating age in small matrices is caused by the occurrence
	of unrealistically fast pathways through the life cycle and is probably
	widespread among tree models with broad categories. Overestimating
	ages in IPMs with narrow categories may be due to temporally autocorrelated
	growth or errors in fitting growth curves. 6. Synthesis. IPMs are
	highly suitable tools to analyse tree demography. We recommend that

	were also highly sensitive to matrix dimension: an IPM with 1000
	size categories yielded 2-4 times higher age estimates for large
	trees than one with 10 size categories. Observed ages obtained from
	tree ring analyses for four of the study species allowed validating
	these estimates. IPMs with 10 categories strongly underestimated
	age, while those with 1000 categories yielded slight age overestimates.
	Underestimating age in small matrices is caused by the occurrence
	of unrealistically fast pathways through the life cycle and is probably
	widespread among tree models with broad categories. Overestimating
	ages in IPMs with narrow categories may be due to temporally autocorrelated
	growth or errors in fitting growth curves. 6. Synthesis. IPMs are
	highly suitable tools to analyse tree demography. We recommend that
	tree IPMs (and classical matrix models) apply narrow diameter categories
	(0.1-1 cm width) to obtain reliable model output.}

  abstract       = {{BACKGROUND
   The gamma-Gompertz model is a fixed frailty model in which baseline
   mortality increases exponentially with age, frailty has a proportional
   effect on mortality, and frailty at birth follows a gamma distribution.
   Mortality selects against the more frail, so the marginal mortality rate
   decelerates, eventually reaching an asymptote. The gamma-Gompertz is one
   of a wider class of frailty models, characterized by the choice of
   baseline mortality, effects of frailty, distributions of frailty, and
   assumptions about the dynamics of frailty.
   OBJECTIVE
   To develop a matrix model to compute all the statistical properties of
   longevity from the gamma-Gompertz and related models.
   METHODS
   I use the vec-permutation matrix formulation to develop a model in which
   individuals are jointly classified by age and frailty. The matrix is
   used to project the age and frailty dynamics of a cohort and the
   fundamental matrix is used to obtain the statistics of longevity.
   RESULTS
   The model permits calculation of the mean, variance, coefficient of
   variation, skewness and all moments of longevity, the marginal mortality
   and survivorship functions, the dynamics of the frailty distribution,
   and other quantities.
   The matrix formulation extends naturally to other frailty models. I
   apply the analysis to the gamma-Gompertz model (for humans and
   laboratory animals), the gamma-Makeham model, and the gamma-Siler model,
   and to a hypothetical dynamic frailty model characterized by diffusion
   of frailty with reflecting boundaries. The matrix model permits
   partitioning the variance in longevity into components due to
   heterogeneity and to individual stochasticity. In several published
   human data sets, heterogeneity accounts for less than 10\% of the
   variance in longevity. In laboratory populations of five invertebrate
   animal species, heterogeneity accounts for 46\% to 83\% of the total
   variance in longevity.}},

   Variation in lifespan has followed strikingly different trends for the
   young and old: while total lifespan variability has decreased as life
   expectancy at birth has risen, the variability conditional on survival
   to older ages has increased. These diverging trends reflect changes in
   the underlying demographic parameters determining age-specific
   mortality.
   OBJECTIVE
   We ask why the variation in the ages at death after survival to adult
   ages has followed a different trend than the variation at younger ages,
   and aim to explain the divergence in terms of the age pattern of
   historical mortality changes.
   METHODS
   Using simulations, we show that the empirical trends in lifespan
   variation are well characterized using the Siler model, which describes
   the mortality trajectory using functions representing early-life,
   later-life, and background mortality. We then obtain maximum likelihood
   estimates of the Siler parameters for Swedish females from 1900 to 2010.
   We express mortality in terms of a Markov chain model, and apply matrix
   calculus to compute the sensitivity of age-specific variance trends to
   the changes in Siler model parameters.
   RESULTS
   Our analysis quantifies the influence of changing demographic parameters
   on lifespan variability at all ages, highlighting the influence of
   declining childhood mortality on the reduction of lifespan variability,
   and the influence of subsequent improvements in adult survival on the
   rising variability of lifespans at older ages.

   These findings provide insight into the dynamic relationship between the

   Population projections using the cohort component method can be written
   as time-varying matrix population models. The matrices are parameterized
   by schedules of mortality, fertility, immigration, and emigration over
   the duration of the projection. A variety of dependent variables are
   routinely calculated (the population vector, various weighted population
   sizes, dependency ratios, etc.) from such projections.
   OBJECTIVE
   Our goal is to derive and apply theory to compute the sensitivity and
   the elasticity (proportional sensitivity) of any projection outcome to
   changes in any of the parameters, where those changes are applied at any
   time during the projection interval.
   METHODS
   We use matrix calculus to derive a set of equations for the sensitivity
   and elasticity of any vector valued outcome xi (t) at time t to any
   perturbation of a parameter vector theta (s) at any time s.
   RESULTS
   The results appear in the form of a set of dynamic equations for the
   derivatives that are integrated in parallel with the dynamic equations
   for the projection itself. We show results for single-sex projections
   and for the more detailed case of projections including age
   distributions for both sexes. We apply the results to a projection of
   the population of Spain, from 2012 to 2052, prepared by the Instituto

   Writing population projections in matrix form makes sensitivity analysis

   As individuals progress through the life cycle, they receive income and
   consume goods and services. The age schedules of labor income,
   consumption, and life cycle deficit reflect the economic roles played at
   different ages. Lifetime accumulation of economic variables has been
   less well studied, and our goal here is to rectify that.
   OBJECTIVE
   To derive and apply a method to compute the lifetime accumulated labor
   income, consumption, and life cycle deficit, and to go beyond the
   calculation of mean lifetime accumulation to calculate statistics of
   variability among individuals in lifetime accumulation.
   METHODS
   To quantify variation among individuals, we calculate the mean, standard
   deviation, coefficient of variation, and skewness of lifetime
   accumulated transfers, using the theory of Markov chains with rewards
   (Caswell 2011), applied to National Transfer Account data for Germany of
   1978, and 2003.
   RESULTS
   The age patterns of lifetime accumulated labor income are relatively
   stable over time. Both the mean and the standard deviation of remaining
   lifetime labor income decline with age; the coefficient of variation,
   measuring variation relative to the mean, increases dramatically with
   age. The skewness becomes large and positive at older ages. Education
   level affects all the statistics. About 30\% of the variance in lifetime
   income is due to variance in age-specific income, and about 70\% is
   contributed by the mortality schedule. Lifetime consumption is less
   variable (as measured by the CV) than lifetime labor income.
   CONCLUSIONS
   We conclude that demographic Markov chains with rewards can add a
   potentially valuable perspective to studies of the economic lifecycle.
   The variation among individuals in lifetime accumulations in our results
   reflects individual stochasticity, not heterogeneity among individuals.
   Incorporating heterogeneity remains an important problem.}},

   This was enlarged to two characteristics in vec-permutation models and
   the closely related megamatrix models. However, it has been recognised
   that the interplay of more than two characteristics can affect the

   2. Here, we present a framework, called hyperstate matrix model, in

   using the generalisation of the vec-permutation approach to
   hypermatrices. These models are constructed froma simple
   block-diagonalmatrix formulation of the movement of individuals among

   3. This framework provides a step-by-step construction and makes
   available the usual demographic analysis developed for classical matrix

   outcome) may arise from heterogeneity or from individual stochasticity.
   Heterogeneity refers to differences among individuals in the demographic
   rates experienced at a given age or stage. Stochasticity refers to
   variation due to the random outcome of demographic rates applied to
   individuals with the same properties. The variance due to individual
   stochasticity can be calculated from a Markov chain description of the
   life cycle. The variance due to heterogeneity can be calculated from a
   multistate model that incorporates the heterogeneity. We show how to use
   this approach to decompose the variance in longevity into contributions
   from stochasticity and heterogeneous frailty for male and female cohorts
   from Sweden (1751-1899), France (1816-1903), and Italy (1872-1899), and
   also for a selection of period data for the same countries.
   Heterogeneity in mortality is described by the gamma-Gompertz Makeham
   model, in which a gamma distributed ``frailty{''} modifies a baseline
   Gompertz Makeham mortality schedule. Model parameters were estimated by
   maximum likelihood for a range of starting ages. The estimates were used
   to construct an age x frailty-classified matrix model, from which we
   compute the variance of longevity and its components due to
   heterogeneous frailty and to individual stochasticity. The estimated
   fraction of the variance in longevity due to heterogeneous frailty
   (averaged over time) is less than 10\% for all countries and for both
   sexes. These results suggest that most of the variance in human
   longevity arises from stochasticity, rather than from heterogeneous
   frailty.},

   investigate ecological and rapid evolutionary change in quantitative
   life-history characteristics and population dynamics. IPMs are
   constructed from functions that describe the demographic rates -
   survival, growth and reproduction - in relation to the characteristics
   of individuals and their environment. Currently, however, demographic
   rates are estimated using phenomenological regression models that lack a
   mechanistic representation of the biological processes that give rise to
   observed demographic variation. This lack of mechanistic underpinning
   limits the ability of the model to predict future dynamics under novel
   environmental conditions because the model ingredients pertain to
   current environmental conditions only. Here, we use dynamic energy
   budget (DEB) theory to construct DEB-IPMs based on a mechanistic
   representation of individual life-history trajectories. We derive the
   demographic functions describing growth and reproduction from a simple
   DEB growth model. The functions describing mortality and the association
   between parent and offspring characteristics do not follow DEB theory
   and hence are estimated from individual-level observations. We apply the
   DEB-IPM to two contrasting systems: the small, fast-reproducing bulb
   mite Rhizoglyphus robini and the large, slow-reproducing reef manta ray
   Manta alfredi. In both cases, predictions of population growth rate,
   lifetime reproductive success and generation time agree with empirical
   observations. In case of the bulb mite, predictions and observations
   even agree across different feeding conditions. If the DEB energetics
   model is accepted as describing growth and reproduction, DEB-IPMs can be
   parameterised using easy-to-collect life cycle information (growth rate,
   length at birth, maturation and old age) making them suitable for
   data-deficient species. Because species differ only in these DEB
   parameters, comparative studies of character and population dynamics
   between species are straightforward, particularly since DEB-IPMs can be
   extended to include population feedback on resources, of which we give
   an example. Most crucially, because DEB theory specifies growth and
   reproduction rates as explicitly dependent on environmental conditions
   such as food availability or temperature, DEB-IPMs provide a mechanistic
   platform to investigate the biological processes that determine joint
   change in phenotypic characters, life-history traits, population size
   and community structure.}},

   2. Here, we evaluate the impact of the combined effects of climate and
   functional traits on population dynamics of a long-lived migratory
   seabird breeding in the southern ocean: the black-browed albatross
   (Thalassarche melanophris, BBA). We address the following prospective
   question: Of all the changes in the climate and functional traits, which
   would produce the biggest impact on the BBA population growth rate?
   3. We develop a structured matrix population model that includes the
   effect of climate and functional traits on the complete BBA life cycle.
   A detailed sensitivity analysis is conducted to understand the main
   pathway by which climate and functional trait changes affect the
   population growth rate.
   4. The population growth rate of BBA is driven by the combined effects
   of climate over various seasons and multiple functional traits with
   carry-over effects across seasons on demographic processes. Changes in
   sea surface temperature (SST) during late winter cause the biggest
   changes in the population growth rate, through their effect on juvenile
   survival. Adults appeared to respond to changes in winter climate
   conditions by adapting their migratory schedule rather than by modifying
   their at-sea foraging activity. However, the sensitivity of the
   population growth rate to SST affecting BBA migratory schedule is small.
   BBA foraging activity during the pre-breeding period has the biggest
   impact on population growth rate among functional traits. Finally,
   changes in SST during the breeding season have little effect on the
   population growth rate.
   5. These results highlight the importance of early life histories and
   carry-over effects of climate and functional traits on demographic rates
   across multiple seasons in population response to climate change. Robust
   conclusions about the roles of various phases of the life cycle and
   functional traits in population response to climate change rely on an

   growth and extinction risk, it is critical to use structured population
   models in which the most important sources of heterogeneity (e.g. age,
   size, developmental stage) are incorporated as i-state variables.
   Demographic stochasticity in heterogeneous populations has often been
   studied using one of two approaches: multitype branching processes and
   diffusion approximations. Here, we link these approaches, through the
   demographic stochasticity in age- or stage-structured matrix population
   models. We derive the demographic variance, sigma(2)(d), which measures
   the per capita contribution to the variance in population growth
   increment, and we show how it can be decomposed into contributions from
   transition probabilities and fertility across ages or stages.
   Furthermore, using matrix calculus we derive the sensitivity of
   sigma(2)(d) to age- or stage-specific mortality and fertility. We apply
   the methods to an extensive set of data from age-classified human
   populations (long-term time-series for Sweden, Japan and the
   Netherlands; two hunter-gatherer populations, and the high-fertility
   Hutterites), and to a size-classified population of the herbaceous plant
   Calathea ovandensis. For the human populations our analysis reveals
   substantial temporal changes in the demographic variance as well as its
   main components across age.
   These new methods provide a powerful approach for calculating the
   demographic variance for any structured model, and for analyzing its
   main components and sensitivities. This will make possible new analyses
   of demographic variance across different kinds of heterogeneity in
   different life cycles, which will in turn improve our understanding of
   mechanisms underpinning extinction risk and other important biological
   outcomes.}},

The theory predicts that if lack of experience is an important constraint, breeding probabilities should increase with experience for individuals of the same age, whereas under the so-called restraint hypothesis, breeding probabilities should increase with age regardless of experience. However, because the probability of detecting individuals in the wild is generally less than 1, it is difficult to know exactly the number of previous breeding episodes (breeding experience). To cope with this issue, we developed a hidden process model to incorporate experience as a latent state possibly influencing the probability of breeding. Using a 22-year mark-recapture dataset involving 9970 individuals, we analysed simultaneously experience and age effects on breeding probabilities in the kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla). We did not detect an influence of age on adult breeding probabilities. We found that inexperienced birds breed less frequently than experienced birds. Our approach enables us to highlight the key role of experience on adults breeding probabilities and can be used for a wide range of organisms for which detection is less than 1.},

abstract = {Abstract Understanding the processes behind change in reproductive state along life-history trajectories is a salient research program in evolutionary ecology. Two processes, state dependence and heterogeneity, can drive the dynamics of change among states. Both processes can operate simultaneously, begging the difficult question of how to tease them apart in practice. The Neutral Theory for Life Histories (NTLH) holds that the bulk of variations in life-history trajectories is due to state dependence and is hence neutral: Once previous (breeding) state is taken into account, variations are mostly random. Lifetime reproductive success (LRS), the number of descendants produced over an individual's reproductive life span, has been used to infer support for NTLH in natura. Support stemmed from accurate prediction of the population-level distribution of LRS with parameters estimated from a state dependence model. We show with Monte Carlo simulations that the current reliance of NTLH on LRS prediction in a null hypothesis framework easily leads to selecting a misspecified model, biased estimates and flawed inferences. Support for the NTLH can be spurious because of a systematic positive bias in estimated state dependence when heterogeneity is present in the data but ignored in the analysis. This bias can lead to spurious positive covariance between fitness components when there is in fact an underlying trade-off. Furthermore, neutrality implied by NTLH needs a clarification because of a probable disjunction between its common understanding by evolutionary ecologists and its translation into statistical models of life-history trajectories. Irrespective of what neutrality entails, testing hypotheses about the dynamics of change among states in life histories requires a multimodel framework because state dependence and heterogeneity can easily be mistaken for each other.},
