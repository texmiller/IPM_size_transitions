To the editorial board:

We are pleased to submit our manuscript for your consideration. In it we provide a practical guide to modeling size transitions for Integral Projection Model (IPM) applications, with the goal of advancing the field beyond out-dated standards of analysis. 

IPMs are widely used in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology to study the dynamics of populations structured by continuous state variables, most commonly size. The size transition sub-model of IPMs typically assumes a Gaussian distribution of future size conditional on current size. However, real size transition data is commonly skewed and/or leptokurtic -- properties that violate the Gaussian assumption. The question we address here is: how can ecologists escape the apparent trade-off between realistically capturing the variance, skew, and kurtosis of size transition data on the one hand, and flexibly including the multiple covariates and random effects that often have substantial impacts on demographic rates? In this article, we offer an answer. 

We describe a pratical general workflow for growth modeling based on visually intuitive graphical diagnostics. Our approach provides criteria to evaluate whether a Gaussian pilot model is adequate, and to select a more appropriate alternative if needed. We illustrate our approach with case studies that revisit published IPM studies, including our own, where Gaussian assumptions do not stand up to scrutiny. None of the tools we use here are new, but they have been slow to trickle into demography and population biology. We hope that this paper will encourage IPM analysts to abandon default (and usually bad) assumptions about growth, and instead develop models truer to the actual population.  

Our manuscript is 35 pages from title page to last reference, which, we realize, exceeds the journal's recommendations. We hope to be considered for publication nonetheless. Our paper first explains and justifies the recommended approach, then illustrates the methods with several case studies intentionally selected to represent the types of data and statistical analyses that readers of this paper are likely to deal with. We could instead split this into two papers, one for methods development and one for applications, but they would have effectively the same Introduction and Discussion and many of the same literature citations, and would collectively take up more page space than necessary. 

We have prepared our manuscript in Latex and consulted ESA guidelines for Latex authors. We were unable to left-justify the text without creating erroneous line breaks, so our submission is right- and left-justified. For the sake of reviewers, we took the liberty of placing figures and legends at appropriate locations in the text. 

All of our data and code are publicly available on Github and in published data packages, as described in our Data Accessibility Statement. We opt out of double-blind review. 

Sincerely,
