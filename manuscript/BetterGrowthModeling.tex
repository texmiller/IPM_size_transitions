\section{Introduction}

Structured demographic models -- matrix and integral projection models (MPMs and IPMs) -- are powerful tools for data-driven modeling of population dynamics and viability that are widely used in basic and applied settings. 
In contrast to MPMs for populations with discrete structure (life stage, age class, etc.), IPMs are a relatively recent development \citep{easterling2000size} best known for their ability to represent populations structured by continuous variables, most commonly size. 
A second, related \tom{innovation}{This `innovation' is not unique to IPMs but it was rare in MPMs before IPMs.} of the IPM framework is its emphasis on modeling size-dependent vital rates as sub-models of the projection `kernel'. 
This means that ecologists could assemble an IPM using familiar regression tools and leverage their capacity for covariates and hierarchical variance structures (i.e., random effects) to statistically describe growth, survival, reprduction, and other demographic transitions as functions of size. 
The relative ease and flexibility of the regression-based approach has facilitated a growing body of IPM literature that examines how covariates of individual demographic fate scale up to affect population dynamics (cite examples) and that partitions demographic heterogeneity associated with space, time, or individual identity (cite examples). 

Compared to other vital rates, growth is special. 
The regression sub-models for survival and reproduction give the expected values of these vital rates as functions of size. 
Modeling growth for an IPM is about more than the expected value: the full  probability distribution of future size, conditioned on previous size, must be defined. 



Steve's stray bits to be incorporated: 

Modeling growth in IPMs is \emph{modeling}, not statistics. Statistical tools and tests inform the process, but do
not dictate it. We are not claiming that we know how to find the ``right'' model for any particular data set or
application through some model selection procedure. Our goal is to demonstrate how a simple workflow, using tools 
that were nonexistent or not readily available when IPMs came into use, makes it straightforward and relatively 
easy to identify when the default choice (Gaussian with possibly nonconstant variance) is a poor fit to the data, 
and to then choose and fit a substantially better growth model that is no harder to use in practice. 


The default growth model traces back to Easterling et al. (2000). The analyses described
there pre-date version 1.0 of R by several years, and they were quickly replaced by better methods such 
as the linear and generalized linear mixed models regression functions in R, notably the option to fit 
linear mixed models with nonconstant growth variance. But as Peterson et al. recently
noted, despite the growing list of other options and repeated calls in the literature 
for greater attention to growth modeling, the general state-of-the-art in the literature remains stuck
where it was 15 or so years ago, using the default model without pausing to examine critically whether or
not it actually provides a good description of the data. Our goal here is to break that logjam, by building on Peterson et al.
to provide a practical ``new default'' that researchers can follow to choose, fit, and implement better descriptions
of individual growth for IPMs and any other size-structured population model.
