  abstract = {In tropical rain forests, rates of forest turnover and tree species'
	life-history differences are shaped by the life expectancy of trees
	and the time taken by seedlings to reach the canopy. These measures
	are therefore of both theoretical and applied interest. However,
	the relationship between size, age, and life expectancy is poorly
	understood. In this paper, we show how to obtain, in a dynamic environment,
	age-related population parameters from data on size and light transitions
	and survival of individuals over single time steps. We accomplish
	this goal by combining two types of analysis (integral projection
	modeling and age-from-stage analysis for variable environments) in
	a new way. The method uses an index of crown illumination (CI) to
	capture the key tree life-history axis of movement through the light
	environment. We use this method to analyze data on nine tropical
	tree species, chosen to sample two main gradients, juvenile recruitment
	niche (gap/nongap) and adult crown position niche (subcanopy, canopy-emergent).
	We validate the method using independent estimates of age and size
	from growth rings and (14)C from some of the same species at the
	same site and use our results to examine correlations among age-related
	population parameters. Finally, we discuss the implications of these
	new results for life histories of tropical trees.},

  abstract = {In both plant and animal systems, size can determine whether an individual
	survives and grows under different environmental conditions. However,
	it is unclear whether and when size-dependent responses to exogenous
	environmental fluctuations affect population dynamics. Size-by-environment
	interactions create pathways for environmental fluctuations to influence
	population dynamics by allowing for negative covariation between
	sizes within vital rates (e.g. small and large individuals have negatively
	covarying survival rates) and/or size-dependent variability in a
	vital rate (e.g. survival of large individuals varies less than small
	individuals through time). Whether these phenomena affect population
	dynamics depends on how they are mediated by elasticities (they must
	affect the sizes and vital rates that matter) and their projected
	impacts will depend on model functional form (the impact of reduced
	variance depends on the relationship between the environment and
	vital rate). We demonstrate these ideas with an analysis of fifteen
	species from five semiarid plant communities. We find that size-by-environment
	interactions are common but do not impact long-term population dynamics.
	Size-by-environment interactions may yet be important for other species.
	Our approach can be applied to species in other ecosystems to determine
	if and how size-by-environment interactions allow them to cope with,
	or exploit, fluctuating environments.},
