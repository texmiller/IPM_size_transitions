  Abstract                 = {1. A change in a climate variable may alter a species abundance not only through a direct effect on that species vital rates, but also through indirect effects mediated by species interactions. While recent work has highlighted cases in which indirect effects overwhelm the direct effects of climate, we lack robust generalizations to predict the strength of indirect effects. 2. For communities dominated by non-trophic interactions, we propose that the potential for indirect effects of climate change declines with the strength of stabilizing niche differences. 3. We tested this hypothesis by analysing an empirically parameterized four species population model. We quantified negative frequency dependence in population growth rates as a measure of stabilizing niche differences and projected the sensitivity of each species to direct and indirect effects of climate perturbations. 4. Consistent with our hypothesis, species' sensitivities to indirect effects decreased rapidly with increasing stabilization by niche differences. 5. Synthesis. Information about niche differences can identify species sensitive to indirect effects of climate change and determine when multispecies forecasting approaches are necessary. However, practical application of this generalization will require methods to predict niche differences from easily collected data.},

  Abstract                 = {Climate variability, which is expected to increase in the future, can promote coexistence through a mechanism called the storage effect. Currently, we have little understanding of how the importance of the storage effect varies among ecosystems. We tested for the three conditions of the storage effect in a sagebrush steppe plant community in Idaho (USA) by combining long-term observational data with statistical models. The four sagebrush steppe species that we studied satisfied the first two conditions of the storage effect: a long-lived life stage and species-specific responses to the environment. But the critical third condition, environment-competition covariance, was very weak in this community. While the direction of the covariance was consistent with a stabilizing effect of variability (stronger competition in more favorable years), its magnitude was small, reflecting low temporal variability in both competition and species responses to the environment. Consistent with this result, simulations of species population growth rates when rare showed that climate variability had no consistent stabilizing effect on coexistence. This case study provides an important reminder that species-specific responses to the environment are not sufficient for coexistence via the storage effect. Instead, the magnitude of temporal variability in species performance also plays an important role. Comparison of our results with those from a similar study in Kansas mixed prairie suggests that temporal variability in species performance may reflect both the strength of environmental variability as well as life history strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {Environmental fluctuations often have different impacts on individuals that differ in size, age, or spatial location. To understand how population structure, environmental fluctuations, and density-dependent interactions influence population dynamics, we provide a general theory for persistence for density-dependent matrix models in random environments. For populations with compensating density dependence, exhibiting ``bounded'' dynamics, and living in a stationary environment, we show that persistence is determined by the stochastic growth rate (alternatively, dominant Lyapunov exponent) when the population is rare. If this stochastic growth rate is negative, then the total population abundance goes to zero with probability one. If this stochastic growth rate is positive, there is a unique positive stationary distribution. Provided there are initially some individuals in the population, the population converges in distribution to this stationary distribution and the empirical measures almost surely converge to the distribution of the stationary distribution. For models with overcompensating density-dependence, weaker results are proven. Methods to estimate stochastic growth rates are presented. To illustrate the utility of these results, applications to unstructured, spatially structured, and stage-structured population models are given. For instance, we show that diffusively coupled sink populations can persist provided that within patch fitness is sufficiently variable in time but not strongly correlated across space.},

  abstract      = {Little is known about how epizootics in natural populations affect vital rates and population structure, or about the process of recovery after an outbreak subsides. We investigated the effects of aspergillosis, an infectious disease caused by the fungal pathogen Aspergillus sydowii, on the demography of a gorgonian coral, Gorgonia ventalina. Caribbean sea fans were affected by a seven-year epizootic, marked by an initial period in 1994 of high infection prevalence, high mortality rates, and almost complete reproductive failure of infected fans. Post epizootic, in 2005, host populations were relatively healthy, with low disease prevalence. Using longitudinal data from populations on coral reefs in the Florida Keys (USA) and the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico), we documented changes in the epidemiology of sea fan aspergillosis over the course of the epizootic. We developed an "integral projection model" that scales disease impacts from individual to population levels using direct estimates of vital rates. Within-colony lesion growth rate and host mortality were higher during the peak of the epizootic. Effects on individuals and populations changed substantially post-epizootic; recruitment increased, mortality of infected adults decreased, and the size dependence of infection was reduced. Elasticity analysis indicated that population growth is more sensitive to changes in the growth and survival of established colonies than to recruitment, due to slow colony growth and the longevity and fecundity of large adults. Disease prevalence in our monitored populations decreased from similar to 50\% in 1997 to <10\% by 2003 and <1\% in 2007 and was accompanied by very high mortality during the early stages of the epizootic. The population model suggested that host evolution (due to selection for higher disease resistance through differential mortality) could proceed quickly enough to explain the observed changes in prevalence and in the size independence of infection risk. Our model indicates that the time required for population recovery following an outbreak is largely determined by the percentage of healthy tissue lost from the population. However, recovery following an especially severe outbreak (i.e., 80\% or more tissue loss) is much faster if the affected population receives an external supply of recruits from unaffected areas.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate prediction of life history phenomena and characterisation of selection in free-living animal populations are fundamental goals in evolutionary ecology. In density regulated, structured populations, where individual state influences fate, simple and widely used approaches based on individual lifetime measures of fitness are difficult to justify. We combine recently developed structured population modelling tools with ideas from modern evolutionary game theory (adaptive dynamics) to understand selection on allocation of female reproductive effort to singletons or twins in a size-structured population of feral sheep. In marked contrast to the classical selection analyses, our model-based approach predicts that the female allocation strategy is under negligible directional selection. These differences arise because classical selection analysis ignores components of offspring fitness and fails to consider selection over the complete life cycle.}

  Abstract                 = {Understanding why individuals delay reproduction is a classic problem in evolutionary biology. In plants, the study of reproductive delays is complicated because growth and survival can be size and age dependent, individuals of the same size can grow by different amounts and there is temporal variation in the environment. We extend the recently developed integral projection approach to include size- and age-dependent demography and temporal variation. The technique is then applied to a long-term individually structured dataset for Carlina vulgaris, a monocarpic thistle. The parameterized model has excellent descriptive properties in terms of both the population size and the distributions of sizes within each age class. In Carlina, the probability of flowering depends on both plant size and age. We use the parameterized model to predict this relationship, using the evolutionarily stable strategy approach. Considering each year separately, we show that both the direction and the magnitude of selection on the flowering strategy vary from year to year. Provided the flowering strategy is constrained, so it cannot be a step function, the model accurately predicts the average size at flowering. Elasticity analysis is used to partition the size- and age-specific contributions to the stochastic growth rate, lambda(s). We use lambda(s) to construct fitness landscapes and show how different forms of stochasticity influence its topography. We prove the existence of a unique stochastic growth rate, lambda(s), which is independent of the initial population vector, and show that Tuljapurkar's perturbation analysis for log(lambda(s)) can be used to calculate elasticities.},

We prove the existence of a unique stochastic growth rate, lambda(s), which is independent of the initial population vector, and show that Tuljapurkar's perturbation analysis for log(lambda(s)) can be used to calculate elasticities.}

  Abstract                 = {We explore the evolution of delayed age- and size-dependent flowering in the monocarpic perennial Carlina vulgaris, by extending the recently developed integral projection approach to include demographic rates that depend on size and age. The parameterized model has excellent descriptive properties both in terms of the population size and in terms of the distributions of sizes within each age class. In Carlina the probability of flowering depends on both plant size and age. We use the parameterized model to predict this relationship, using the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) approach. Despite accurately predicting the mean size of flowering individuals, the model predicts a step-function relationship between the probability of flowering and plant size, which has no age component. When the variance of the flowering-threshold distribution is constrained to the observed value, the ESS flowering function contains an age component, but underpredicts the mean flowering size. An analytical approximation is used to explore the effect of variation in the flowering strategy on the ESS predictions. Elasticity analysis is used to partition the age-specific contributions to the finite rate of increase (lambda) of the survival-growth and fecundity components of the model. We calculate the adaptive landscape that defines the ESS and generate a fitness landscape for invading phenotypes in the presence of the observed flowering strategy. The implications of these results for the patterns of genetic diversity in the flowering strategy and for testing evolutionary models are discussed. Results proving the existence of a dominant eigenvalue and its associated eigenvectors in general size- and age-dependent integral projection models are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {1. There is a growing number of empirical reports of environmental change simultaneously influencing population dynamics, life history and quantitative characters. We do not have a well-developed understanding of links between the dynamics of these quantities. 2. Insight into the joint dynamics of populations, quantitative characters and life history can be gained by deriving a model that allows the calculation of fundamental quantities that underpin population ecology, evolutionary biology and life history. The parameterization and analysis of such a model for a specific system can be used to predict how a population will respond to environmental change. 3. Age-stage-structured models can be constructed from character-demography associations that describe age-specific relationships between the character and: (i) survival; (ii) fertility; (iii) ontogenetic development of the character among survivors; and (iv) the distribution of reproductive allocation. 4. These models can be used to calculate a wide range of useful biological quantities including population growth and structure; terms in the Price equation including selection differentials; estimates of biometric heritabilities; and life history descriptors including generation time. We showcase the method through parameterization of a model using data from a well-studied population of Soay sheep Ovis aries. 5. Perturbation analysis is used to investigate how the quantities listed in summary point 4 change as each parameter in each character-demography function is altered. 6. A wide range of joint dynamics of life history, quantitative characters and population growth can be generated in response to changes in different character-demography associations; we argue this explains the diversity of observations on the consequences of environmental change from studies of free-living populations. 7. The approach we describe has the potential to explain within and between species patterns in quantitative characters, life history and population dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite seemingly obvious effects of environmental drivers, mechanisms behind long-term changes in plant population sizes over time are often poorly known. We investigated how soil potassium concentration and seed predation are likely to change over time as a result of succession from deciduous forest to spruce forest, and how this affects population trajectories of Actaea spicata. Observations and addition experiments showed that high soil potassium concentration increased individual growth rates. Among-site comparisons showed that soil potassium concentration was lower where proportion spruce was higher. Incorporation of a gradual increase in spruce over time in an integral projection model where individual growth depended on potassium suggested a net decrease in A. spicata population sizes over forest succession. This result suggests that small changes in factors with small effects on individual performance can influence patterns of species occupancy along successional gradients. We incorporated also density independent and density dependent effects of pre-dispersal seed predation over succession into the same model. Seed predation influenced the tree composition at which A. spicata population growth was positive. However, significant effects of A. spicata population size on seed predation intensity did not translate into important feedback effects on population growth trajectories over succession. Our results illustrate how demographic models can be used to gain understanding of the mechanisms behind effects of environmental change on species abundances and distributions by the simultaneous inclusion of changing abiotic and biotic factors.},

We stress the importance of testing for nonlinearity and propose using restricted cubic splines in order to allow for a wide variety of relationships in regressions and demographic models. For the plant Borderea pyrenaica, we found that vital rate relationships with size and age were nonlinear and that the parameterization method had large effects on predicted population growth rates, lambda (linear IPM, 0.95; nonlinear IPMs, 1.00; matrix model, 0.96). Our results suggest that restricted cubic spline models are more reliable than linear or polynomial models.

Understanding the links between historical variation in climate and population vital rates (survival, growth, recruitment) is one way to predict the impact of future climate change. Using a unique, long-term data set from eastern Idaho, USA, we parameterized integral projection models (IPMs) for Pseudoroegneria spicata, Hesperostipa comata, and Artemisia tripartita to identify the demographic rates and climate variables most important for population growth. We described survival, growth, and recruitment as a function of genet size using mixed-effect regression models that incorporated climate variables. Elasticites for the survival + growth portion of the kernel were larger than the recruitment portion for all three species, with survival + growth accounting for 87-95\% of the total elasticity. The genet sizes with the highest elasticity values in each species were very close to the genet size threshold where survival approached 100\%. We found strong effects of climate on the population growth rate of two of our three species. In H. comata, a 1\% decrease in previous year's precipitation would lead to a 0.6\% decrease in population growth. In A. tripartita, a 1\% increase in summer temperature would result in a 1.3\% increase in population growth. In both H. comata and A. tripartita, climate influenced population growth by affecting genet growth more than survival or recruitment. Late-winter snow was the most important climate variable for P. spicata, but its effect on population growth was smaller than the climate effects we found in H. comata or A. tripartita. For all three species, demographic responses lagged climate by at least one year. Our analysis indicates that understanding climate effects on genet growth may be crucial for anticipating future changes in the structure and function of sagebrush steppe vegetation.},

In H. comata, a 1% decrease in previous year's precipitation would lead to a 0.6% decrease in population growth. In A. tripartita, a 1% increase in summer temperature would result in a 1.3% increase in population growth. In both H. comata and A. tripartita, climate influenced population growth by affecting genet growth more than survival or recruitment. Late-winter snow was the most important climate variable for P. spicata, but its effect on population growth was smaller than the climate effects we found in H. comata or A. tripartita. For all three species, demographic responses lagged climate by at least one year. Our analysis indicates that understanding climate effects on genet growth may be crucial for anticipating future changes in the structure and function of sagebrush steppe vegetation.}

  Abstract                 = {Matrix population models require the population to be divided into discrete stage classes. In many cases, especially when classes are defined by a continuous variable, such as length or mass, there are no natural breakpoints, and the division is artificial. We introduce the "integral projection model," which eliminates the need for division into discrete classes, without requiring any additional biological assumptions. Like a traditional matrix model, the integral projection model provides estimates of the asymptotic growth rare, stable size distribution, reproductive values, and sensitivities of the growth rate to changes in vital rates. However, where the matrix model represents the size distributions, reproductive value, and sensitivities as step functions (constant within a stage class), the integral projection model yields smooth curves fur each of these as a function of individual size. We describe a method for fitting the model to data, and we apply this method to data on an endangered plant species, northern monkshood (Aconitum noveboracense). With individuals classified by stem diameter. The matrix and integral models yield similar estimates of the asymptotic growth rate, bur the reproductive values and sensitivities in the matrix model are sensitive to the choice of stage classes. The integral projection model avoids this problem and yields size-specific sensitivities that are not affected by stags duration. These general properties of the integral projection model will make it advantageous for other populations where there is no natural division of individuals into stage classes.}

  Abstract                 = {Stochastic matrix projection models are widely used to model age- or stage-structured populations with vital rates that fluctuate randomly over time. Practical applications of these models rest on qualitative properties such as the existence of a long term population growth rate, asymptotic log-normality of total population size, and weak ergodicity of population structure. We show here that these properties are shared by a general stochastic integral projection model, by using results in (Eveson in D. Phil. Thesis, University of Sussex, 1991, Eveson in Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. 70, 411-440, 1993) to extend the approach in (Lange and Holmes in J. Appl. Prob. 18, 325-344, 1981). Integral projection models allow individuals to be cross-classified by multiple attributes, either discrete or continuous, and allow the classification to change during the life cycle. These features are present in plant populations with size and age as important predictors of individual fate, populations with a persistent bank of dormant seeds or eggs, and animal species with complex life cycles. We also present a case-study based on a 6-year field study of the Illyrian thistle, Onopordum illyricum, to demonstrate how easily a stochastic integral model can be parameterized from field data and then applied using familiar matrix software and methods. Thistle demography is affected by multiple traits (size, age and a latent "quality" variable), which would be difficult to accommodate in a classical matrix model. We use the model to explore the evolution of size- and age-dependent flowering using an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) approach. We find close agreement between the observed flowering behavior and the predicted ESS from the stochastic model, whereas the ESS predicted from a deterministic version of the model is very different from observed flowering behavior. These results strongly suggest that the flowering strategy in O. illyricum is an adaptation to random between-year variation in vital rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Matrix projection models occupy a central role in population and conservation biology. Matrix models divide a population into discrete classes, even if the structuring trait exhibits continuous variation ( e. g., body size). The integral projection model ( IPM) avoids discrete classes and potential artifacts from arbitrary class divisions, facilitates parsimonious modeling based on smooth relationships between individual state and demographic performance, and can be implemented with standard matrix software. Here, we extend the IPM to species with complex demographic attributes, including dormant and active life stages, cross- classification by several attributes ( e. g., size, age, and condition), and changes between discrete and continuous structure over the life cycle. We present a general model encompassing these cases, numerical methods, and theoretical results, including stable population growth and sensitivity/ elasticity analysis for density- independent models, local stability analysis in density- dependent models, and optimal/ evolutionarily stable strategy life- history analysis. Our presentation centers on an IPM for the thistle Onopordum illyricum based on a 6- year field study. Flowering and death probabilities are size and age dependent, and individuals also vary in a latent attribute affecting survival, but a predictively accurate IPM is completely parameterized by fitting a few regression equations. The online edition of the American Naturalist includes a zip archive of R scripts illustrating our suggested methods.}

  Abstract                 = {We analyze how temporal variability in local demography and dispersal combine to affect the rate of spread of an invading species. Our model combines state-structured local demography (specified by an integral or matrix projection model) with general dispersal distributions that may depend on the state of the individual or its parent. It allows very general patterns of stationary temporal variation in both local demography and in the frequency and distribution of dispersal distances. We show that expressions for the asymptotic spread rate and its sensitivity to parameters, which have been derived previously for less general models, continue to hold. Using these results we show that random temporal variability in dispersal can accelerate population spread. Demographic variability can further accelerate spread if it is positively correlated with dispersal variability, for example if high-fecundity years are also years in which juveniles tend to settle further away from their parents. A simple model for the growth and spread of patches of an invasive plant (perennial pepperweed, Lepidium latifolium) illustrates these effects and shows that they can have substantial impacts on the predicted speed of an invasion wave. Temporal variability in dispersal has received very little attention in both the theoretical and empirical literature on invasive species spread. Our results suggest that this needs to change.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Understanding how vital rates and reproductive value change with age is fundamental to demography, life history evolution and population genetics. The universality of organism senescence has been questioned on both theoretical and empirical grounds, and the prevalence and strength of senescence remain a controversial issue. Plants are particularly interesting for studies of senescence since individuals of many species have been reported to reach very high ages. 2. In this study, we examined whether the herb Borderea pyrenaica, known to reach ages of more than 300 years, experiences senescence. We collected detailed demographic information from male and female individuals in two populations over 5 years. An unusual morphological feature in this species enabled us to obtain exact age estimates for each of the individuals at the end of the demographic study. 3. We used restricted cubic regression splines and generalized linear models to determine nonlinear effects of age and size on vital rates. We then incorporated the effects of age and size in integral projection models of demography for determining the relationship between age and reproductive value. As the species is dioecious, we performed analyses separately for males and females and examined also the hypothesis that a larger reproductive effort in females comes at a senescence cost. 4. We found no evidence for senescence. Recorded individuals reached 260 years, but growth and fecundity of female and male individuals did not decrease at high ages, and survival and reproductive value increased with age. The results were qualitatively similar also when accounting for size and among-individual vital rate heterogeneity, with the exception that male flowering probability decreased with age when accounting for size increases. 5. Synthesis. Overall, our results show that performance of both male and female plants of B. pyrenaica may increase rather than decrease at ages up to several centuries, and they support the notion that senescence may be negligible in long-lived modular organisms. This highlights the need to explore mechanisms that enable some species to maintain high reproductive values also at very high ages and to identify the evolutionary reasons why some organisms appear to experience no or negligible senescence.}

  abstract = {We present a model for the evolutionary dynamics of seed size when there is a trade-off between seed size and seed number, and seedlings from large seeds are better competitors and have a higher precompetitive survival than seedlings from small seeds. We find that strong competitive asymmetry, high resource levels, and intermediate harshness of the precompetitive environment favor coexistence of plants with different seed sizes. If the evolution of seed size is mutation-limited and single mutations have only a small phenotypic effect, then an initially monomorphic population reaches the final evolutionarily stable polymorphic state through one or more discrete evolutionary branching events. At each such branching event, a given lineage already present in the population divides into two phenotypically diverging daughter lines, each with its own seed size. If the precompetitive survival of seeds and seedlings is high for small and large seeds alike, however, evolutionary branching may be followed by the extinction of one or more lineages. Various results presented here are model-independent and point the way to a more general evolutionary bifurcation theory describing how the number and stability properties of evolutionary equilibria may change as a consequence of changes in model parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {Dense ungulate populations in forest accompanied by high grazing intensities have the potential to affect plant population dynamics, and such herbivory effects on populations are hypothesised to differ along environmental gradients. We investigated red deer grazing and resource interaction effects on the performance and dynamics of the functionally important boreal shrub Vaccinium myrtillus using integral projection models (IPMs). We sampled data from 900 V. myrtillus ramets in 30 plots in two consecutive years across the boreo-nemoral pine forest on the island Svanoy, western Norway. The plots spanned two environmental gradients: a red deer grazing intensity gradient (assessed by Cervus elaphus faecal pellets), and a relative resource gradient (DCA-ordination of species composition). The use of IPMs enabled projections of population growth rate (lambda) using continuous plant size instead of forcing stage division upon the demographic data. We used the environmental gradients as continuous variables to explain the dynamics of V. myrtillus populations and found that both increasing grazing intensity and resource levels negatively affected lambda of the V. myrtillus populations. Interestingly, these factors interacted: the negative effects of grazing were strongest in the resource-rich vegetation, and higher resource levels reduced lambda more strongly than at low resource levels when grazing intensities became higher. Populations with lambda > 1 were projected if the grazing intensity was less than or equal to the mean grazing intensity on the island, and indicated that V. myrtillus is relatively tolerant of grazing. Variance decomposing showed that the decrease of lambda along the grazing gradient, both at low and high resource levels, was largely caused by reductions in plant growth. The use of IPMs together with important environmental gradients offered novel possibilities to study the synthesised effect of different factors on plant population dynamics. Here, we show that the population response of an abundant boreal shrub to ungulate grazing depends on resource level.},

We investigate how habitat-specific demographic variation and the production of multiple offspring types affect the population dynamics and evolution of delayed reproduction in a clonal perennial herb with monocarpic ramets (white hellebore). In this species, flowering ramets produce both seeds and asexual offspring. Data on ramet demography are used to parameterize integral projection models, which allow the effects of habitat-specific demographic variation and reproductive mode on population dynamics to be quantified. We then use the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) approach to predict the flowering strategy-the relationship between flowering probability and size. This approach is extended to allow offspring types to have different demographies and density-dependent responses. Our results demonstrate that the evolutionarily stable flowering strategies differ substantially among habitats and are in excellent agreement with the observed strategies. Reproductive mode, however, has little effect on the ESSs. Using analytical approximations, we show that flowering decisions are predominantly determined by the asymptotic size of individuals rather than variation in survival or size-fecundity relationships. We conclude that habitat is an important aspect of the selective environment and a significant factor in predicting the ESSs.},

  Abstract                 = {P>1. In woodland herbs, the probability of flowering and costs associated with reproduction may strongly depend on environmental context (shade vs. light habitats) and on plant size. This may be particularly true for tuberous orchids that inhabit woodlands, as the amount of incoming radiation and total leaf area strongly determine photosynthetic capacity and hence the amount of carbohydrates that can be relocated to below-ground storage organs that form next year's rosette and flowering stalk. 2. To fully comprehend the impact of size-dependent reproduction on population dynamics under varying light conditions, life cycle models should therefore include plant size in a continuous manner. In this study, annual changes in plant size and demographic behaviour of the tuberous perennial orchid Orchis purpurea were monitored during seven consecutive years (2003-2009) in open and shaded woodland. Integral projection models (IPMs) and life table response experiments (LTRE) were used to investigate the extent to which variation in plant size affected the overall population dynamics of this species and to decompose differences in population growth rates between populations of open and shaded woodland into contributions from growth, survival and reproduction. 3. Both plants in shaded and light environments needed to be a certain size to initiate flowering, but this threshold size was almost three times as large in shaded environments as in light environments. Plants in open woodlands flowered more frequently over the years, showed less size regression after flowering and produced significantly more fruits than plants in shaded environments, resulting in significantly larger population growth rates. 4. Our life cycle models revealed that costs of reproduction, measured at the population-level, were small in the light environment, and more than buffered by the increase in survival of flowering plants compared to non-flowering plants. In the shade environment, however, the costs of reproduction were significant and made the difference between a stable (current) and a growing (without reproduction costs) population. 5. Synthesis. Light penetration to the soil is a key variable determining population dynamics of woodland orchids. Our analyses show that differences in vital rates related to size-dependent reproduction (flowering) and growth are essential drivers of changes in orchid population dynamics in different light environments. The combination of IPMs and LTREs thus proves to be very useful when studying the fitness consequences of size- and context-dependent phenomena like flowering strategies and costs of reproduction.},

  Abstract                 = {Plant survival, growth, and flowering are size dependent in many plant populations but also vary among individuals of the same size. This individual variation, along with variation in dispersal caused by differences in, e.g., seed release height, seed characteristics, and wind speed, is a key determinant of the spread rate of species through homogeneous landscapes. Here we develop spatial integral projection models (SIPMs) that include both demography and dispersal with continuous state variables. The advantage of this novel approach over discrete-stage spread models is that the effect of variation in plant size and size-dependent vital rates can be studied at much higher resolution. Comparing Neubert-Caswell matrix models to SIPMs allowed us to assess the importance of including individual variation in the models. As a test case we parameterized a SIPM with previously published data on the invasive monocarpic thistle Carduus nutans in New Zealand. Spread rate (c*) estimates were 34\% lower than for standard spatial matrix models and stabilized with as few as seven evenly distributed size classes. The SIPM allowed us to calculate spread rate elasticities over the range of plant sizes, showing the size range of seedlings that contributed most to c* through their survival, growth and reproduction. The annual transitions of these seedlings were also the most important ones for local population growth (lambda). However, seedlings that reproduced within a year contributed relatively more to c* than to lambda. In contrast, plants that grow over several years to reach a large size and produce many more seeds, contributed relatively more to lambda than to c*. We show that matrix models pick up some of these details, while other details disappear within wide size classes. Our results show that SIPMs integrate various sources of variation much better than discrete-stage matrix models. Simpler, heuristic models, however, remain very valuable in studies where the main goal is to investigate the general impact of a life history stage on population dynamics. We conclude with a discussion of future extensions of SIPMs, including incorporation of continuous time and environmental drivers.},

Therefore, spatial population models, that bring together knowledge about a species' local demography and dispersal behavior, are of growing applied importance. Here, we survey increasingly complex analytical and simulation models that are being developed to describe both demography and dispersal in applied studies. Local population dynamics can be modeled in an unstructured way, by specifying age- or stage-structure or by modeling each individual. Dispersal is often summarized in population-spread models with descriptive and simple statistical models. Mechanistic models that incorporate the physical or behavioral dynamics of dispersal vectors, however, provide more insight and can more readily be applied to novel situations. Importantly, mechanistic models provide a tool for linking variation in species traits and environments to dispersal and population spread. Spatial population models span a wide range: from diffusion models, metapopulation models, integrodifference equation models, and Neubert-Caswell models, to spatially explicit individual-based models. The complexity (and biological realism) of such models often trades off with tractability: for instance, individual-based simulation models allow for unlimited incorporation of biological detail, but rarely for analytical exploration of the model dynamics. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these various spatial population models; the choice of the most appropriate model will depend on the management objective, the biological complexity, available data and the principle of parsimony. We present five case studies of endangered and invasive species for which spatial population models have been developed to inform management, for instance to decrease the spread rate of invasive species or to improve the regional persistence of endangered species. We also anticipate exciting new developments in both spatial analytical and spatial simulation models with increasing demographic, dispersal and spatial sophistication.

  Abstract                 = {Spatial population dynamics can seldom be ignored in management aimed at conserving or controlling plant species in a spatial context. Therefore, spatial population models, that bring together knowledge about a species' local demography and dispersal behavior, are of growing applied importance. Here, we survey increasingly complex analytical and simulation models that are being developed to describe both demography and dispersal in applied studies. Local population dynamics can be modeled in an unstructured way, by specifying age- or stage-structure or by modeling each individual. Dispersal is often summarized in population-spread models with descriptive and simple statistical models. Mechanistic models that incorporate the physical or behavioral dynamics of dispersal vectors, however, provide more insight and can more readily be applied to novel situations. Importantly, mechanistic models provide a tool for linking variation in species traits and environments to dispersal and population spread. Spatial population models span a wide range: from diffusion models, metapopulation models, integrodifference equation models, and Neubert-Caswell models, to spatially explicit individual-based models. The complexity (and biological realism) of such models often trades off with tractability: for instance, individual-based simulation models allow for unlimited incorporation of biological detail, but rarely for analytical exploration of the model dynamics. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these various spatial population models; the choice of the most appropriate model will depend on the management objective, the biological complexity, available data and the principle of parsimony. We present five case studies of endangered and invasive species for which spatial population models have been developed to inform management, for instance to decrease the spread rate of invasive species or to improve the regional persistence of endangered species. We also anticipate exciting new developments in both spatial analytical and spatial simulation models with increasing demographic, dispersal and spatial sophistication.

  Abstract                 = {Plants often interact with antagonists such as herbivores or pathogens. Negative effects on individual plant performance are widely documented, but less is known about whether such effects translate into effects on population viability. In temperate forests, important herbivores include deer. During 2006-2009, I compared vital rates and population growth rates (calculated using integral projection models) between fenced exclosures and grazed control areas, using the perennial herb Phyteuma spicatum as a model species. Deer caused the largest damage to flowering individuals, removing about 24\% of all inflorescences and 13\% of the above-ground biomass. Only few vital rates seemed to be negatively affected by deer (mainly seed production) and this did not translate into effects on population growth rate. Contrary to expectations, population growth rates tended to be lower in the fenced exclosures in 1 year. This was likely caused by high-pathogen infestation rates, which negatively affected the probability of adult survival and growth. Population growth rate was more sensitive to changes in these vital rates than to changes in seed production. In summary, the results of this demographic study show that grazing effects may be small for long-lived herbs, and that negative effects on vital rates such as seed production may not always translate into effects on population growth rate. The findings also illustrate that other antagonists such as pathogens may be of greater relative importance for differences in population performance than herbivores.},

In this study, we examined relationships between population size, individual growth, survival and reproduction, and population growth rate in the perennial plant Phyteuma spicatum. Population size positively affected the growth of seedlings, the survival of juveniles, the proportion of adults flowering, and potential seed production.

We conclude that effects of population size on vital rates must not translate into effects on population growth rate, and that populations of long-lived organisms may partly be able to buffer negative effects of small population size on vital rates that have a relatively small influence on population growth rate.

  Abstract                 = {Integrodifference equations are discrete-time models that possess many of the attributes of continuous-time reaction-diffusion equations. They arise naturally in population biology as models for organisms with discrete nonoverlapping generations and well-defined growth and dispersal stages. I examined the varied travelling waves that arise in some simple ecologically-interesting integrodifference equations. For a scalar equation with compensatory growth, I observed only simple travelling waves. For carefully chosen redistribution kernels, one may derive the speed and approximate the shape of the observed waveforms. A model with overcompensation exhibited flip bifurcations and travelling cycles in addition to simple travelling waves. Finally, a simple predator-prey system possessed periodic wave trains and a variety of travelling waves.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The evolution of flowering strategies (when and at what size to flower) in monocarpic perennials is determined by balancing current reproduction with expected future reproduction, and these are largely determined by size-specific patterns of growth and survival. However, because of the difficulty in following long-lived individuals throughout their lives, this theory has largely been tested using short-lived species ( < 5 years). 2. Here, we tested this theory using the long-lived monocarpic perennial Campanula thyrsoides which can live up to 16 years. We used a novel approach that combined permanent plot and herb chronology data from a 3-year field study to parameterize and validate integral projection models (IPMs). 3. Similar to other monocarpic species, the rosette leaves of C. thyrsoides wither over winter and so size cannot be measured in the year of flowering. We therefore extended the existing IPM framework to incorporate an additional time delay that arises because flowering demography must be predicted from rosette size in the year before flowering. 4. We found that all main demographic functions (growth, survival probability, flowering probability and fecundity) were strongly size-dependent and there was a pronounced threshold size of flowering. There was good agreement between the predicted distribution of flowering ages obtained from the IPMs and that estimated in the field. Mostly, there was good agreement between the IPM predictions and the direct quantitative field measurements regarding the demographic parameters $\lambda$ , R 0 and T . We therefore conclude that the model captures the main demographic features of the field populations. 5. Elasticity analysis indicated that changes in the survival and growth function had the largest effect ( c . 80\%) on $\lambda$ and this was considerably larger than in short-lived monocarps. We found only weak selection pressure operating on the observed flowering strategy which was close to the predicted evolutionary stable strategy. 6. Synthesis. The extended IPM accurately described the demography of a long-lived monocarpic perennial using data collected over a relatively short period. We could show that the evolution of flowering strategies in short- and long-lived monocarps seem to follow the same general rules but with a longevity-related emphasis on survival over fecundity.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Maintaining viable populations in different habitats requires physiological, morphological and demographic adaptations of plants. In sandland environments, plants experience substantial variation in growing conditions during the dune fixation process, with high sand mobility in early stages and denser vegetation cover in later stages. 2. We studied the changes in demography of a dominant shrub, Artemisia ordosica, at three stages of dune fixation: semi-fixed dunes, fixed dunes and fixed dunes covered with microbiotic crust. Demographic data from three annual censuses were used to parameterize integral projection models (IPMs) to conduct comparative demographic analyses. 3. Plant growth and reproduction decreased strongly as dunes became more fixed. Shrinkage in plant height occurred very frequently, particularly in the fixed dunes with microbiotic crust. Population growth rate (lambda) declined substantially with dune fixation: from rapid expansion in semi-fixed dunes (lambda = 1.35-1.09) to moderate decline in fixed dunes with microbiotic crust (lambda = 0.94-0.89). 4. Elasticity analysis revealed that survival was a key vital rate for population growth in all habitats. Growth and fecundity were of higher importance in the semi-fixed habitat than in the other two habitats where shrinkage became an important factor determining lambda. Seedlings and small plants were critical for population growth in semi-fixed dunes, whereas moderate to large-sized plants were most important in the other habitats. 5. Results of life table response experiments showed that the observed strong decrease in lambda during dune fixation was mainly caused by reduction in fecundity, but with additional and considerable contributions from reduced plant growth and increased occurrence of shrinkage. Thus, populations in semi-fixed dunes are able to expand rapidly due to a much higher fecundity compared to those in other habitats. 6. Synthesis. Artemisia ordosica adopts different life history strategies along the dune fixation process. Fast expansion in semi-fixed dunes is enabled by high seed production and effective recruitment, while populations at later dune fixation stages are maintained through frequent plant shrinkage.

  Abstract                 = {In tropical rain forests, rates of forest turnover and tree species' life-history differences are shaped by the life expectancy of trees and the time taken by seedlings to reach the canopy. These measures are therefore of both theoretical and applied interest. However, the relationship between size, age, and life expectancy is poorly understood. In this paper, we show how to obtain, in a dynamic environment, age-related population parameters from data on size and light transitions and survival of individuals over single time steps. We accomplish this goal by combining two types of analysis (integral projection modeling and age-from-stage analysis for variable environments) in a new way. The method uses an index of crown illumination (CI) to capture the key tree life-history axis of movement through the light environment. We use this method to analyze data on nine tropical tree species, chosen to sample two main gradients, juvenile recruitment niche (gap/nongap) and adult crown position niche (subcanopy, canopy-emergent). We validate the method using independent estimates of age and size from growth rings and (14)C from some of the same species at the same site and use our results to examine correlations among age-related population parameters. Finally, we discuss the implications of these new results for life histories of tropical trees.},

A closely related field has successfully captured many key axes of the evolution of timing of flowering in other monocarpic species through statistical and demographic modelling of large empirical databases. There has as yet been no synthesis between these two fields. Here we examine ways in which the two fields inform each other, and how this synergy will shape our knowledge of life-history evolution as a whole.},

  Abstract                 = {In plants where reproduction is fatal, seed-feeding insects may have a major impact on the evolutionarily stable reproductive strategy by altering fecundity schedules in a size-dependent manner. We explored this in Carduus nutans, a facultative biennial native to Europe, using two years of data from the South of France. An integral projection model based on detailed statistical models of the demography of Carduus nutans and characteristics of herbivore attack showed that seed predators select for smaller flowering size. An elasticity analysis showed that changes in the slope relating seed herbivore attack rates to plant total receptacle area had a large effect on lifetime reproductive success relative to most other plant demographic rates. Together, these two results indicate that in the absence of seed predators, as is the case in the exotic range of this invasive species, flowering size could evolve to be larger. Further analysis also showed that subsequent introduction of different species of seed-feeders as biocontrol agents could lead to different evolutionary outcomes dependent on the ecological characteristics of the seed-feeders, allowing the direction and magnitude of evolutionary change in flowering size to be predicted based on what seed predators have been introduced where and when. Such data would allow us to distinguish between the effect of seed predators and other hypotheses for size increase in the invasive habitat.},

Yet, while the negative effects of herbivory on plant performance have been well documented, we know much less about how individual-level damage translates to impacts on population growth or whether spatial variation in herbivory affects patterns of plant distribution. We studied the role of insect herbivory in the dynamics and distribution of the tree cholla cactus (Opuntia imbricata), a long-lived perennial plant, across an elevational gradient in central New Mexico, USA, from low-elevation grassland (1670 m) to a grassland-mountain transition zone (1720 m) to the rocky slopes of the Los Pinos Mountains (1790 m). Tree cholla density increased significantly with elevation, while abundance of and damage by a suite of native, cactus-feeding insects decreased. We combined field experiments and demographic models to test the hypothesis that systematic spatial variation in chronic insect herbivory limits the tree cholla distribution to a subset of suitable habitat across the gradient. Our results support this hypothesis. We found that key demographic functions (survival, growth, fecundity) and the responses of these functions to experimental reductions in insect herbivory varied across the gradient. The effects of insect exclusion on plant growth and seed production were strongest in the low-elevation grassland and decreased in magnitude with increasing elevation. We used the experimental data to parameterize integral projection models (IPM), which predict the asymptotic rate of population increase (lambda). The modeling results showed that insect herbivory depressed lambda and that the magnitude of this effect was context-dependent. The effect of insect herbivory on population growth was strongest at low elevation (Delta lambda(low) = 0.095), intermediate at mid elevation (Delta lambda(mid) = 0.046), and weakest at high elevation (Delta lambda(high) = -0.0089). The total effect of insects on lambda was due to a combination of reductions in growth and in fecundity and their combination; the relative contribution of each of these effects varied spatially. Our results, generated by experimental demography across a heterogeneous landscape, provide new insights into the role of native consumers in the population dynamics and distribution of abundance of long-lived native plants.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the role of consumers in plant population dynamics is important, both conceptually and practically. Yet, while the negative effects of herbivory on plant performance have been well documented, we know much less about how individual-level damage translates to impacts on population growth or whether spatial variation in herbivory affects patterns of plant distribution. We studied the role of insect herbivory in the dynamics and distribution of the tree cholla cactus (Opuntia imbricata), a long-lived perennial plant, across an elevational gradient in central New Mexico, USA, from low-elevation grassland (1670 m) to a grassland-mountain transition zone (1720 m) to the rocky slopes of the Los Pinos Mountains (1790 m). Tree cholla density increased significantly with elevation, while abundance of and damage by a suite of native, cactus-feeding insects decreased. We combined field experiments and demographic models to test the hypothesis that systematic spatial variation in chronic insect herbivory limits the tree cholla distribution to a subset of suitable habitat across the gradient. Our results support this hypothesis. We found that key demographic functions (survival, growth, fecundity) and the responses of these functions to experimental reductions in insect herbivory varied across the gradient. The effects of insect exclusion on plant growth and seed production were strongest in the low-elevation grassland and decreased in magnitude with increasing elevation. We used the experimental data to parameterize integral projection models (IPM), which predict the asymptotic rate of population increase (lambda). The modeling results showed that insect herbivory depressed lambda and that the magnitude of this effect was context-dependent. The effect of insect herbivory on population growth was strongest at low elevation (Delta lambda(low) = 0.095), intermediate at mid elevation (Delta lambda(mid) = 0.046), and weakest at high elevation (Delta lambda(high) = -0.0089). The total effect of insects on lambda was due to a combination of reductions in growth and in fecundity and their combination; the relative contribution of each of these effects varied spatially. Our results, generated by experimental demography across a heterogeneous landscape, provide new insights into the role of native consumers in the population dynamics and distribution of abundance of long-lived native plants.},

  Abstract                 = {Linear mixed effects models are highly flexible in handling a broad
 range of data types and are therefore widely used in applications. A key
 part in the analysis of data is model selection, which often aims to
 choose a parsimonious model with other desirable properties from a
 possibly. very large set of candidate statistical models. Over the last
 5-10 years the literature on model selection in linear mixed models has
 grown extremely rapidly. The problem is much more complicated than in
 linear regression because selection on the covariance structure is not
 straightforward due to computational issues and boundary problems
 arising from positive semidefinite constraints on covariance matrices.
 To obtain a better understanding of the available methods, their
 properties and the relationships between them, we review a large body of
 literature on linear mixed model selection. We arrange, implement,
 discuss and compare model selection methods based on four major
 approaches: infoimation criteria such as AIC or BIC, shrinkage methods
 based on penalized loss functions such as LASSO, the Fence procedure and
 Bayesian techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the dispersal-driven instabilities that arise in a discrete-time predator-prey model formulated as a system of integrodifference equations. Integrodifference equations contain two components: (1) difference equations, which model growth and interactions during a sedentary stage, and (2) redistribution kernels, which characterize the distribution of dispersal distances that arise during a vagile stage. Redistribution kernels have been measured for a tremendous number of organisms. We derive a number of redistribution kernels from first principles. Integrodifference equations generate pattern under a far broader set of ecological conditions than do reaction-diffusion models. We delineate the necessary conditions for dispersal-driven instability for two-species systems and follow this with a detailed analysis of a particular predator-prey model.

  Abstract                 = {1. To predict the viability of populations, it is essential to clarify how performance depends both on large-scale environmental changes, such as climate warming, and on the local habitat. However, in spite of their potential importance, effects of interactions between large-scale environmental changes and the local environment on population viability have rarely been examined. 2. We investigated how population dynamics of the endangered alpine plant Dracocephalum austriacum depend on local habitat quality and climatic variation, as well as how effects of climate depend on local habitat. We used lasso regression shrinkage and integral projection models to identify effects on vital rates and population growth rates in seven populations over seven annual transitions. 3. Populations on steeper slopes had lower survival and stochastic population growth rate than populations on more gentle slopes. In years with low spring temperatures and high summer temperatures, survival and population growth rate were lower. In addition, the negative effects of high summer temperatures did depend on local habitat quality, being more negative in populations on steeper slopes. 4. Combining the net positive effects of high spring temperature and the net negative effects of high summer temperature on plant vital rates with predicted climate change over the next 30 years suggested that effects on D. austriacum would be relatively small. 5. Synthesis. Our results show that different aspects of a warmer climate may have opposing effects on populations, and that climatic effects may depend on local habitat quality. Such interactive effects should be accounted for when determining effects of large-scale environmental changes on population and community dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {Environmental change has altered the phenology, morphological traits and population dynamics of many species(1,2). However, the links underlying these joint responses remain largely unknown owing to a paucity of long-term data and the lack of an appropriate analytical framework(3). Here we investigate the link between phenotypic and demographic responses to environmental change using a new methodology and a long-term (1976-2008) data set from a hibernating mammal (the yellow-bellied marmot) inhabiting a dynamic subalpine habitat. We demonstrate how earlier emergence from hibernation and earlier weaning of young has led to a longer growing season and larger body masses before hibernation. The resulting shift in both the phenotype and the relationship between phenotype and fitness components led to a decline in adult mortality, which in turn triggered an abrupt increase in population size in recent years. Direct and trait-mediated effects of environmental change made comparable contributions to the observed marked increase in population growth. Our results help explain how a shift in phenology can cause simultaneous phenotypic and demographic changes, and highlight the need for a theory integrating ecological and evolutionary dynamics in stochastic environments(4,5).},

  Abstract                 = {Environmental change continually perturbs populations from a stable state, leading to transient dynamics that can last multiple generations. Several long-term studies have reported changes in trait distributions along with demographic response to environmental change. Here we conducted an experimental study on soil mites and investigated the interaction between demography and an individual trait over a period of nonstationary dynamics. By following individual fates and body sizes at each life-history stage, we investigated how body size and population density influenced demographic rates. By comparing the ability of two alternative approaches, a matrix projection model and an integral projection model, we investigated whether consideration of trait-based demography enhances our ability to predict transient dynamics. By utilizing a prospective perturbation analysis, we addressed which stage-specific demographic or trait-transition rate had the greatest influence on population dynamics. Both body size and population density had important effects on most rates; however, these effects differed substantially among life-history stages. Considering the observed trait-demography relationships resulted in better predictions of a population's response to perturbations, which highlights the role of phenotypic plasticity in transient dynamics. Although the perturbation analyses provided comparable predictions of stage-specific elasticities between the matrix and integral projection models, the order of importance of the life-history stages differed between the two analyses. In conclusion, we demonstrate how a trait-based demographic approach provides further insight into transient population dynamics.},

The model is constructed from submodels that predict an individual tree's growth, survival, dispersal, and recruitment, and submodels that predict the local availability of resources. Competition is entirely mechanistic; plants interfere with one another only by depleting resources. We also describe maximum likelihood methods for estimating each of the submodels from data collected in the field. Over the past two years, we collected the necessary data for the dominant tree species in the Great Mountain Forest (Norfolk, Conn.). We report estimates of submodels for each species, and show that the calibrated population dynamic model predicts the structure and dynamics of natural forests. Finally, we contrast our model with the JABOWA-FORET family of forest models.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper shows that the processes controlling tree-scale spatial heterogeneity in forests have large effects on system-level properties such as standing crop, and on community-level properties such as successional species turnover. A `'mean field'' version of the forest simulation model SORTIE is developed in which horizontal spatial heterogeneity is eliminated while vertical structure is retained. The mean-field model maintains only approximately one half the standing crop and looses successional diversity approximately twice as fast as the full spatial model. Data from natural stands support the spatial model. A partial differential equation limit of the mean-field simulator is also derived. The results are set in the context of ongoing efforts to develop models intended to predict the biosphere's response to global change. The importance of processes governing fine-scale spatial heterogeneity implies that biospheric models will agree with nature only ii they are phenomenological (e.g. fitted to data) at large scale, or if spatial scaling rules are discovered that allow one to derive system-level properties from individual-level processes.},

  Abstract                 = {The perfect-plasticity approximation (PPA) is an analytically tractable model of forest dynamics, defined in terms of parameters for individual trees, including allometry, growth, and mortality. We estimated these parameters for the eight most common species on each of four soil types in the US Lake states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota) by using short-term (<= 15-year) inventory data from individual trees. We implemented 100-year PPA simulations given these parameters and compared these predictions to chronosequences of stand development. Predictions for the timing and magnitude of basal area dynamics and ecological succession on each soil were accurate, and predictions for the diameter distribution of 100-year-old stands were correct in form and slope. For a given species, the PPA provides analytical metrics for early-successional performance (H-20, height of a 20-year-old open-grown tree) and late-successional performance (Z{*}, equilibrium canopy height in monoculture). These metrics predicted which species were early or late successional on each soil type. Decomposing Z{*} showed that (i) succession is driven both by superior understory performance and superior canopy performance of late-successional species, and (h) performance differences primarily reflect differences in mortality rather than growth. The predicted late-successional dominants matched chronosequences on xeromesic (Quercus rubra) and mesic (codominance by Acer rubrum and Acer saccharum) soil. On hydromesic and hydric soils, the literature reports that the current dominant species in old stands (Thuja occidentalis) is now failing to regenerate. Consistent with this, the PPA predicted that, on these soils, stands are now succeeding to dominance by other late-successional species (e.g., Fraxinus nigra, A. rubrum).},

To do this, we extend the standard IPM to include a discrete state variable representing the number of seeds in the seed bank, densityâdependent recruitment, and temporal variation in demography. Parameter estimates for Carlina vulgaris and Carduus nutans are obtained from longâterm studies. Carlina is relatively long lived and has a shortâlived seed bank, whereas most Carduus plants flower in their first year and the seed bank is long lived. Using the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) approach, we predict the observed flowering and germination strategies. There is excellent agreement between the predictions and the field observations. The effects of temporal variation on the joint ESS are partitioned into components arising from nonlinear averaging (systematic changes in the mean resulting from the interaction between variability and nonlinearity) and nonequilibrium dynamics (fluctuations in fitness caused by temporal variation). This shows that temporal variation can have substantial effects on the observed flowering and germination strategies and that covariance between demographic processes is important. We extend the models to include spatial population structure and assess the robustness of the results from the nonspatial models.},

  Abstract                 = {We explore the effects of temporal variation in multiple demographic rates on the joint evolution of delayed reproduction and seed dormancy using integral projection models ( IPMs). To do this, we extend the standard IPM to include a discrete state variable representing the number of seeds in the seed bank, density- dependent recruitment, and temporal variation in demography. Parameter estimates for Carlina vulgaris and Carduus nutans are obtained from long- term studies. Carlina is relatively long lived and has a shortlived seed bank, whereas most Carduus plants flower in their first year and the seed bank is long lived. Using the evolutionarily stable strategy ( ESS) approach, we predict the observed flowering and germination strategies. There is excellent agreement between the predictions and the field observations. The effects of temporal variation on the joint ESS are partitioned into components arising from nonlinear averaging ( systematic changes in the mean resulting from the interaction between variability and nonlinearity) and nonequilibrium dynamics ( fluctuations in fitness caused by temporal variation). This shows that temporal variation can have substantial effects on the observed flowering and germination strategies and that covariance between demographic processes is important. We extend the models to include spatial population structure and assess the robustness of the results from the nonspatial models.},

We develop methods for decomposing the effects of temporal variation in demography into contributions from nonlinear averaging and non-equilibrium dynamics. We illustrate the approach using Carlina vulgaris, a monocarpic species in which recruitment, growth and survival all vary from year to year. In Carlina the absolute effect of temporal variation on the evolutionarily stable flowering strategy is substantial (ca. 50\% of the evolutionarily stable flowering size) but the net effect is much smaller (ca. 10\%) because the effects of temporal variation do not influence the evolutionarily stable strategy in the same direction.},

  Abstract                 = {Plant growth plays a key role in the functioning of the terrestrial
 biosphere, and there have been substantial efforts to understand why
 growth varies among species. To this end, a large number of experimental
 analyses have been undertaken; however, the emergent patterns between
 growth rate and its components are often contradictory. We believe that
 these conflicting results are a consequence of the way growth is
 measured. Growth is typically characterized by relative growth rate
 (RGR); however, RGR often declines as organisms get larger, making it
 difficult to compare species of different sizes. To overcome this
 problem, we advocate using nonlinear mixed-effects models so that RGR
 can be calculated at a standard size, and we present easily implemented
 methods for doing this. We then present new methods for analyzing the
 traditional components of RGR that explicitly allow for the fact that
 log (RGR) is the sum of its components. These methods provide an exact
 decomposition of the variance in log (RGR). Finally, we use simple
 analytical and simulation approaches to explore the effect of size
 variation on growth and its components and show that the relative
 importance of the components of RGR is influenced by the extent to which
 analyses standardize for plant size.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The conventional explanations for large plant species producing larger seeds on average than small plant species have recently been challenged, and it has been suggested that the pattern is better explained by the theory developed by Charnov (1993). Here we use simple life-history theory to explore the logic underlying Charnov's models and show that under most reasonable conditions they predict no relationship between seed mass and size at maturity. 2. Using a simple general model incorporating size-specific growth and survival, we explore the joint evolution of seed mass and size at maturity, and argue that seed mass will be correlated with adult traits, such as the timing of reproduction and size at reproduction, only if seedling and adult growth and mortality rates are correlated. Evidence for such correlations is briefly explored. 3. It has also been suggested that the standard model for seed mass evolution (Smith & Fretwell 1974) has been misinterpreted, and that application of the model requires measurement of survivorship to reproductive maturity. Using a simple model incorporating size-specific growth and survival we show that this criticism is unfounded. 4. Our results differ from those of Moles and colleagues because they look at the effect of long juvenile period on survival to maturity, but do not recognize that this may be compensated by covarying life-history traits, such as plant size and reproductive lifespan. Also, they seem to argue that life-history evolution is constrained by cross-angiosperm correlations, such as that between seed mass and longevity, while the life-history models presented here seek selective causes of such correlations, rather than regarding them as constraints. 5. Models similar to those of Charnov (1993) only predict a positive relationship between seed size and plant size if unrealistic assumptions are made about the effects of seed mass on survival, such as the effect of seed mass on instantaneous survival persisting to adulthood.},

  Abstract                 = {Invasive species have the potential to alter trade-offs leading to selection in the populations they invade. Here we quantify the demographic and selective effects of herbivory by native insects and the introduced floral feeder Rhinocyllus conicus on Platte thistle (Cirsium canescens), a sparse monocarpic thistle endemic to North America. Rhinocyllus first invaded the Platte thistle population in 1993. Since then, its numbers have increased exponentially, while the Platte thistle population size has decreased. Data from 11 years were analyzed to determine how demographic rates varied with plant size and damage by native insects and Rhinocyllus. Individual growth, survival, flowering probability, and seed set were all size dependent.

  Abstract                 = {Prediction of the role of native insect herbivores in the population growth and spatial distribution of native plants within the environment remains limited. We developed an integral projection model (IPM) to explore the effect of native insect herbivores on the population dynamics and distribution of the native plant Cirsium altissimum (tall thistle), in two different productivity zones in tallgrass prairie in Nebraska USA. Model parameters were extracted from two field experiments: a seed addition experiment that demonstrated seed limitation by insect herbivores on adult recruitment and an insect herbivory exclusion experiment that demonstrated significant herbivore impacts on both rosette performance and adult fecundity. Zones differed in elevation, soil moisture and biomass. Using our model, we asked: (1) does insect herbivory reduce plant population growth rate (lambda), (2) does the effect on (lambda) differ between productivity zones, (3) does it primarily operate by limiting growth or fecundity and (4) is there evidence for density dependence in mediating impact on (lambda)? We found that insect herbivory suppressed tall thistle population growth rate, but the magnitude of this effect did not vary with ecosystem productivity. Insect herbivores' effect on lambda arose primarily through suppression of fecundity. We found no evidence of negative density dependence countering seed limitation effects of insect herbivory on tall thistle population growth. The similar magnitudes of these effects in different productivity zones eliminate variation in ecosystem productivity as a majority condition in determining insect herbivores' impact in shaping local distribution of this native plant. Overall, the results show that native insect herbivores suppress population growth of this native plant, mediated through seed limitation that functionally determines adult density, without differences related to ecosystem productivity.},

  Abstract                 = {Density-dependent effects on vital rates may vary in both magnitude and direction at different stages of the life cycle. In monocarpic perennials, however, it is often assumed that recruitment is the stage most affected by density. The spatial pattern of newly emerged individuals of the facultative biennial Digitalis purpurea was recorded and followed in five 0.5-m(2) plots censused twice during each of three seasons. To examine effects of local density on growth and survival, a plant's neighbourhood was defined as the number of individuals inside a circle of fixed radius around it. Species identity of the nearest neighbour was established to see whether the effects of intra- and interspecific interactions differed. Relative growth rate (RGR) was negatively related to local density during both of the first two summers, but not during winter. In 1998 the negative effects were stronger when the closest neighbour was conspecific. Contrasting patterns of size-dependent growth were found during summer and winter, with summer RGR an increasing, and winter RGR a decreasing, function of size. Summer survival was generally high, and was positively related to spring size. There was a significant negative effect of increasing local density on survival probability in 1998. No effect of neighbour identity was detected. Winter survival was low, and mainly dependent on autumn size, with no significant effects of local density in any season. During the first winter, individuals with a conspecific as the nearest neighbour had lower survival probabilities. There was no evidence of a tradeoff between summer RGR and survival probability. Density-dependent effects may be significant beyond the recruitment stage in monocarpic perennials such as D. purpurea. Density dependence was strongest at early life stages although, because effects on growth persisted into the second year, it is likely that local density may influence timing of reproduction in this population. The use of detailed studies investigating the timing and magnitude of density dependence across the entire life cycle may provide new insight into life history evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite recent, strong interest in the modelling of monocarpic perennial flowering strategies, little is known about how variation in demographic rates affects selection on optimal timing of flowering. Temporal variation may yield fluctuating selective pressures, or, if individuals experience time trends, selection for phenotypic plasticity. Here we report the results of a 3-year study in a large field population of the facultative biennial herb Digitalis purpurea, where we use field data on size-dependent growth, survival and fecundity to parameterize an existing optimisation model. We compare results from models using either deterministic or individually varying demographic rates to address the degree of fluctuating selection on the flowering strategy. In addition, we explore whether recent growing conditions influence the size-specific liability to flower. Model results differed widely between years; immediate onset of reproduction was predicted in 1999, strongly delayed reproduction in 2000. This reflected large differences in both growth and survival rates between years. Observed flowering sizes also varied between years, but were larger in 1999 than in 2000, contrary to model predictions. Incorporating individual variation in growth increased predicted optimal flowering sizes compared to models using deterministic growth, whereas the inclusion of individual survival variation had little effect. There was no significant effect of recent growth rate on flowering probability. Taken together, these results indicate highly fluctuating selection on the flowering strategy in D. purpurea, but no evidence of adaptive plasticity in response to current growing conditions. Fluctuating selection may contribute to maintain genetic variation for threshold size for flowering, and may partly explain the large within-season size-variation in flowering individuals found in natural populations of D. purpurea.},

  Abstract                 = {Both theoretical and empirical work have shown that the temporal storage effect can promote coexistence. However, the storage effect depends on temporally fluctuating demographic rates, such as interannually variable germination rates. Because variable demographic rates often reduce fitness, we asked how a storage effect might evolve. Using a model of competing annual plants, we find that variable germination (and hence a storage effect) can evolve only if germination is positively correlated with high-fecundity years (predictive germination) or if one species has limited ability to evolve. Outside of these conditions, the storage effect is evolutionarily unstable: if two species were thrown together with traits that would permit a storage effect, they would coevolve constant germination rates and the storage effect would vanish. Our results suggest that for the temporal storage effect to be widespread, either germination must commonly be positively correlated with later growth or fecundity or community assembly must reflect biogeographic processes more than they do coevolution.},

These structures can give rise to complex population dynamics and interact with environmental conditions. Here we present a model for continuously structured populations with finite size, including both demographic and environmental stochasticity in the dynamics. Using recent methods developed for discrete age-structured models we derive the demographic and environmental variance of the population growth as functions of a continuous state variable. These two parameters, together with the expected population growth rate, are used to define a one-dimensional diffusion approximation of the population dynamics. Thus, a substantial reduction in complexity is achieved as the dynamics of the complex structured model can be described by only three population parameters. We provide methods for numerical calculation of the model parameters and demonstrate the accuracy of the diffusion approximation by computer simulation of specific examples. The general modeling framework makes it possible to analyze and predict future dynamics and extinction risk of populations with various types of structure, and to explore consequences of changes in demography caused by, e. g., climate change or different management decisions. Our results are especially relevant for small populations that are often of conservation concern.},

  Abstract                 = {Body size is one of the most important traits of organisms and allows predictions of an individual's morphology, physiology, behaviour and life history. However, explaining the evolution of complex traits such as body size is difficult because a plethora of other traits influence body size. Here I review what we know about the evolution of body size in a group of island reptiles and try to generalize about the mechanisms that shape body size. Galapagos marine iguanas occupy all 13 larger islands in this Pacific archipelago and have maximum island body weights between 900 and 12 000 g. The distribution of body sizes does not match mitochondrial clades, indicating that body size evolves independently of genetic relatedness. Marine iguanas lack intra- and inter-specific food competition and predators are not size-specific, discounting these factors as selective agents influencing body size. Instead I hypothesize that body size reflects the trade-offs between sexual and natural selection. We found that sexual selection continuously favours larger body sizes. Large males establish display territories and some gain over-proportional reproductive success in the iguanas' mating aggregations. Females select males based on size and activity and are thus responsible for the observed mating skew. However, large individuals are strongly selected against during El Nimo-related famines when dietary algae disappear from the intertidal foraging areas. We showed that differences in algae sward ('pasture') heights and thermal constraints on large size are causally responsible for differences in maximum body size among populations. I hypothesize that body size in many animal species reflects a trade-off between foraging constraints and sexual selection and suggest that future research could focus on physiological and genetic mechanisms determining body size in wild animals. Furthermore, evolutionary stable body size distributions within populations should be analysed to better understand selection pressures on individual body size.},

I first compared vital rates between ranges. I then used these vital rates to parameterize integral projection models to calculate the population growth rate (lambda) and net reproductive rate (R(0)) as surrogates for fitness to compare strategies within and between ranges. I found that both survival and growth were higher in the introduced range, where size at flowering was larger and iteroparity was much more common than in the native range. The observed and predicted strategies for size at flowering were similar in the native range. In the introduced range, however, even though plants flowered at a larger size, the observed size was not as large as the optimum predicted by lambda or the higher optimum predicted by R(0). Iteroparity conferred higher fitness in both ranges, as measured by both fitness metrics, suggesting that severe constraints, potentially specialist herbivores, prevent this strategy from becoming more common in the native range.},

  Abstract                 = {Life-history theory makes several key predictions about reproductive strategies on the basis of demographic vital rates, particularly the relationship between juvenile and adult survival. Two such predictions concern the optimal time to begin reproducing and whether semelparity or iteroparity is favored. I tested these life-history predictions and explored how they might differ between the native and introduced ranges of the monocarpic perennial Cynoglossum officinale. I first compared vital rates between ranges. I then used these vital rates to parameterize integral projection models to calculate the population growth rate (lambda) and net reproductive rate (R(0)) as surrogates for fitness to compare strategies within and between ranges. I found that both survival and growth were higher in the introduced range, where size at flowering was larger and iteroparity was much more common than in the native range. The observed and predicted strategies for size at flowering were similar in the native range. In the introduced range, however, even though plants flowered at a larger size, the observed size was not as large as the optimum predicted by lambda or the higher optimum predicted by R(0). Iteroparity conferred higher fitness in both ranges, as measured by both fitness metrics, suggesting that severe constraints, potentially specialist herbivores, prevent this strategy from becoming more common in the native range.}

  Abstract                 = {A central question in ecology concerns how some exotic plants that occur at low densities in their native range are able to attain much higher densities where. they are introduced. This question has remained unresolved in part due to a lack of experiments that assess factors that affect the population growth or abundance of plants in both ranges. We tested two hypotheses for exotic plant success: escape from specialist insect herbivores and a greater response to disturbance in the introduced range. Within three introduced populations in Montana, USA, and three native populations in Germany, we experimentally manipulated insect herbivore pressure and created small-scale disturbances to determine how these factors affect the performance of houndstongue (Cynoglossum officinale), a widespread exotic in western North America. Herbivores reduced plant size and fecundity in the native range but had little effect on plant performance in the introduced range. Small-scale experimental disturbances enhanced seedling recruitment in both ranges, but subsequent seedling survival was more positively affected by disturbance in the introduced range. We combined these experimental results with demographic data from each population to parameterize integral projection population models to assess how enemy escape and disturbance might differentially influence C. officinale in each range. Model results suggest that escape from specialist insects would lead to only slight increases in the growth rate (lambda) of introduced populations. In contrast, the larger response to disturbance in the introduced vs. native range had much greater positive effects on lambda. These results together suggest that, at least in the regions where the experiments were performed, the differences in response to small disturbances by C. officinale contribute more to higher abundance in the introduced range compared to at home. Despite the challenges of conducting experiments on a wide biogeographic scale and the logistical constraints of adequately sampling populations within a range, this approach is a critical step forward to understanding the success of exotic plants.},

Demographic data of A. patens growing in patches characterized by Bromus inermis, Poa pratensis, or native grasses were used to parameterize integral projection models.

Extinction probabilities indicate that A. patens should persist in native grass patches, but has a much higher probability of extinction in Bromus patches compared to Poa patches. While sensitivity analyses showed that survival had the biggest effect on population growth rates in all habitats, results of a Life Table Response Experiment (LTRE) revealed that slower individual growth rates in patches of invasive grasses contributed the most to the observed reduction in population growth. These results suggest that invasive grasses may cause slow declines in A. patens, despite short-term coexistence, and that controlling B. inermis only would not be sufficient to ensure A. patens persistence.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Matrix models are popular tools for plant demographic studies, but their application to long-lived, slow-growing species is hampered by the fact that (i) model output is highly sensitive to category width and (ii) growth variation between individuals can only be partially accounted for. Integral Projection Models (IPMs) - an extension of matrix models - offer a solution to these problems. 2. Here, we introduce a new method to parameterize IPMs for trees - the 'integration method'- which allows constructing IPMs for long-lived, slow-growing species. This approach is more suitable than the 'midpoint rule', which is customarily used. 3. We built IPMs for six tree species from Vietnamese (sub)tropical forests. For four of these species, population growth rate (lambda) was highly sensitive to the number of categories in the transition matrix. Population growth stabilized for IPMs with 100-1000 categories, corresponding to categories of 0.1-1 cm in trunk diameter. This preferred width is much narrower than the 10-cm-wide categories customarily used in tree models. 4. The distribution of elasticity values over transition types (stasis, progression to next and further categories) is also highly sensitive to matrix dimension in IPMs. In addition, elasticity distribution is influenced by including or excluding growth variation. 5. Age estimates obtained from IPMs were also highly sensitive to matrix dimension: an IPM with 1000 size categories yielded 2-4 times higher age estimates for large trees than one with 10 size categories. Observed ages obtained from tree ring analyses for four of the study species allowed validating these estimates. IPMs with 10 categories strongly underestimated age, while those with 1000 categories yielded slight age overestimates. Underestimating age in small matrices is caused by the occurrence of unrealistically fast pathways through the life cycle and is probably widespread among tree models with broad categories. Overestimating ages in IPMs with narrow categories may be due to temporally autocorrelated growth or errors in fitting growth curves. 6. Synthesis. IPMs are highly suitable tools to analyse tree demography. We recommend that tree IPMs (and classical matrix models) apply narrow diameter categories (0.1-1 cm width) to obtain reliable model output.},
