This repo provides code and data accompanying the manuscript "My, how you've grown: A practical guide to modeling size transitions for Integral Projection Model (IPM) applications". It also provides the manuscript, itself. Each case study analysis may be reproduced from data and code in the correspondingly named folders. Results from cross-species analyses (Table 1, Figures 3-4) may be reproduced from code in the "cross-species analysis" folder, which calls outputs from the individual case studies. The "code" sub-folder includes diagnostic tests that are called by the case study scripts. Finally, the "manuscript" folder includes the .tex file that compiles the manuscript. Figures are written from R scripts directly to "manuscript/figures".
